## 4. EQUATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS

### Equation 1: Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC) from Far-Field Radiation

**Equation:**
```
ρₑ = |∫∫₄π [F₁(θ, φ)* · F₂(θ, φ)] dΩ|² / {∫∫₄π |F₁(θ, φ)|² dΩ · ∫∫₄π |F₂(θ, φ)|² dΩ}
```

**Where:** [file:26]
- F₁(θ, φ) = three-dimensional far-field radiation pattern of antenna element 1
- F₂(θ, φ) = three-dimensional far-field radiation pattern of antenna element 2
- * = complex conjugate operator
- · = dot product
- Ω = solid angle
- dΩ = solid angle differential element

**Application:** [file:26]
- Used to evaluate MIMO performance and channel correlation
- ECC values of single-band system: < 0.007 (excellent diversity)
- ECC values of dual-band system: < 0.317 (lower band), < 0.009 (higher band)
- Criterion: ECC should be < 0.5 for acceptable MIMO performance

---

### Equation 2: Mean Effective Gain (MEG) - Taga's Formula

**Equation:**
```
MEG = ∫₀²π ∫₀π {[XPR/(1+XPR)] × Gθ(θ, φ) × Pθ(θ, φ) + [1/(1+XPR)] × Gφ(θ, φ) × Pφ(θ, φ)} sin θ dθ dφ
```

**Where:** [file:26]
- MEG = mean effective gain (ratio of mean received power to total mean incident power)
- XPR = cross-polarization power ratio (mean incident power ratio of vertically and horizontally polarized waves)
- Gθ(θ, φ) = antenna gain component in theta direction
- Gφ(θ, φ) = antenna gain component in phi direction
- Pθ(θ, φ) = theta component of normalized angular power density function of incoming plane waves
- Pφ(θ, φ) = phi component of normalized angular power density function of incoming plane waves
- θ = elevation angle (0 to π)
- φ = azimuth angle (0 to 2π)
- sin θ dθ dφ = solid angle weighting element

**Application:** [file:26]
- MEGs of all proposed antenna elements remain stable within operational bands
- MEGs approximately satisfy equality criteria for good MIMO diversity and system power balancing
- Single-band MEG: approximately –3.5 to –4.5 dB
- Dual-band MEG: approximately –2.5 to –4.5 dB

---

### Equation 3: Diversity Gain (DG)

**Equation:**
```
G_DG = 10 × √(1 - |ρ|²)
```

**Where:** [file:26]
- G_DG = diversity gain (in dB)
- ρ = correlation coefficient (from ECC)
- |ρ|² = magnitude squared of correlation coefficient
- √(1 - |ρ|²) = diversity factor

**Application:** [file:26]
- Single-band diversity gain: > 9.96 dB
- Dual-band diversity gain: > 9.82 dB
- Higher values indicate better MIMO performance and lower antenna correlation
