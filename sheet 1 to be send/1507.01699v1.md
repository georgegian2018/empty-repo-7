**Paper:** Millimeter Wave MIMO with Lens Antenna Array: A New Path Division Multiplexing Paradigm

**Authors:** Yong Zeng and Rui Zhang

**Abstract (as in paper):**

```text
Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication over the largely unused mmWave spectrum is a promising technology for the ﬁfth-generation (5G) cellular systems. To compensate for the severe path loss in mmWave communications, large antenna arrays are generally used at both the transmitter and receiver to achieve signiﬁcant beamforming gains. However, the high hardware and power consumption cost due to the large number of radio frequency (RF) chains required renders the traditional beamforming method impractical for mmWave systems. It is thus practically valuable to achieve the large- antenna gains, but with only limited number of RF chains for mmWave communications. To this end, we study in this paper a new lens antenna array enabled mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system. We ﬁrst show that the array response of the proposed lens antenna array at the receiver/transmitter follows a “sinc” function, where the antenna with the peak response is determined by the angle of arrival (AoA)/departure (AoD) of the received/transmitted signal. By exploiting this unique property of lens antenna arrays along with the multi-path sparsity of mmWave channels, we propose a novel low-cost and capacity-achieving MIMO transmission scheme, termed orthogonal path division multiplexing (OPDM). With OPDM, multiple data streams are simultaneously transmitted in parallel over different propagation paths with simple per- path signal processing at both the transmitter and receiver. For channels with insufﬁciently separated AoAs and/or AoDs, we also propose a simple path grouping technique with group- based small-scale MIMO processing to mitigate the inter-path interference. Numerical results are provided to compare the performance of the proposed lens antenna arrays for mmWave MIMO system against that of conventional arrays, under differ- ent practical setups. It is shown that the proposed system achieves signiﬁcant throughput gain as well as complexity and hardware cost reduction, both making it an appealing new paradigm for mmWave MIMO communications.

## Simulation Results and Performance Metrics

capacity is achieved
by the well-known eigenmode transmission with WF power
allocation based on singular value decomposition (SVD) over
the MIMO channel matrix [40]. It is observed from Fig. 6
that under the ideal AoA/AoD environment, the lens MIMO
using OPDM achieves almost the same capacity as that by
the conventional UPA-based MIMO. However, their required
signal processing complexity and hardware cost are rather
different, as will be shown in the next subsection.
Fig. 7 compares the lens MIMO using OPDM versus
the UPA-based MIMO using MIMO-OFDM in wide-band
communication. For MIMO-OFDM, the total bandwidth is
divided into N = 512 orthogonal sub-bands, and a cyclic
preﬁx (CP) of length 100 ns is assumed. It is observed in Fig. 7
that for the wide-band communication case, the lens MIMO

## Technical Specifications of Each Antenna or Relevant Component

A. Lens Antenna Array
A lens antenna array in general consists of an EM lens and
an antenna array with elements located in the focal region of
the lens. Without loss of generality, we assume that a planar
EM lens with negligible thickness and of size Dy × Dz is
placed on the y-z plane and centered at the origin, as shown
in Fig. 1. By considering only the azimuth AoAs and AoDs,2
the array elements are assumed to be placed on the focal
arc of the lens, which is deﬁned as a semi-circle around the
lens’s center in the azimuth plane (i.e., x-y plane shown in
Fig. 1) with radius F, where F is known as the focal length of
the lens. Therefore, the antenna locations relative to the lens
center can be parameterized as Bm(xm = F cos θm, ym =
−F sin θm, zm = 0), where θm ∈[−π/2, π/2] is the angle of
the mth antenna element relative to the x-axis, m ∈M, with
M ≜{0, ±1, · · · , ±(M −1)/2} denoting the set of antenna
indices and M representing the total number of antennas.
Note that we have assumed that M is an odd number for
convenience. Furthermore, we assume the so-called critical
antenna spacing, i.e., the antenna elements are deployed on
the focal arc so that {˜θm ≜sin θm} are equally spaced in the
interval [−1, 1] as
˜θm = m
˜D
, m ∈M,
(1)
where ˜D ≜Dy/λ is the effective lens dimension along the az-
imuth plane, with λ denoting the carrier wavelength. It follows
from (1) that M and ˜D are related via M = 1 + ⌊2 ˜D⌋, i.e.,
more antennas should be deployed for larger lens dimension
˜D. It is worth mentioning that with the array conﬁguration
speciﬁed in (1), antennas are more densely deployed in the
center of the array than those on each of the two edges.
We ﬁrst study the receive array response by assuming that
the lens antenna array is illuminated by a uniform plane
wave with AoA φ, as shown in Fig. 1. Denote by x0(φ) the
impinging signal at the reference point (say, the lens center)
on the lens aperture, and rm(φ) the resulting signal received
by the mth element of the antenna array, m ∈M. The array
response vector a(φ) ∈CM×1, whose elements are deﬁned
by the ratio am(φ) ≜rm(φ)/x0(φ), can then be obtained in
the following lemma.
2For simplicity, we assume that the elevation AoAs/AoDs are all zeros,
which is practically valid if the height difference between the transmitter and
the receiver is much smaller than their separation distance.

4
Fig. 1: The schematic diagram of a lens antenna array with
an incident uniform plane wave with AoA φ.
Lemma 1: For the lens antenna array with critical antenna
spacing as speciﬁed in (1), the receive array response vector
a(φ) as a function of the AoA φ is given by
am(φ) =
√
Asinc(m −˜D ˜φ), m ∈M,
(2)
where A ≜DyDz/λ2 is the effective aperture of the EM lens,
and ˜φ ≜sin φ ∈[−1, 1] is referred to as the spatial frequency
corresponding to the AoA φ.
Proof: Please refer to Appendix A.
Different from the traditional antenna arrays without lens,
whose array responses are generally given by the simple phase
shifting across different antenna elements (see e.g. (11) for
the case of UPAs), the “sinc”-function array response in (2)
demonstrates the AoA-dependent energy-focusing capability
of the lens antenna arrays, which is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Speciﬁcally, for any incident signal with a given AoA φ, the
received power is magniﬁed by approximately A times for
the receiving antenna located in the close vicinity of the focal
point ˜D ˜φ; whereas it is almost negligible for those antennas
located far away from the focal point, i.e., antennas with
|m −˜D ˜φ| ≫1. As a result, any two simultaneously received
signals with sufﬁciently different AoAs φ and φ′ such that
|˜φ −˜φ′| ≥1/ ˜D can be effectively separated in the spatial
domain, as illustrated in Fig. 2 assuming a lens antenna array
with A = 100 and ˜D = 10 for two AoAs with sin φ = 0
and 0.18, respectively. Thus, we term the quantity 1/ ˜D as the
array’s spatial frequency resolution, or approximately the AoA
resolution for large ˜D [27].
On the other hand, since the EM lens is a passive device,
reciprocity holds between the incoming and outgoing signals
through it. As a result, the transmit response vector for steering
a signal towards the AoD φ can be similarly obtained by
Lemma 1.
B. Channel Model for MmWave Lens MIMO
In this subsection, we present the channel model for the
mmWave lens MIMO system, where both the transmitter and

ment.
receiver are equipped with lens antenna arrays with Q and M
elements, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. Under the general
multi-path environment, the channel impulse response can be
modeled as
H(t) =
L
X
l=1
αlaR(φR,l)aH
T (φT,l)δ(t −τl),
(3)
where H(t) is an M×Q matrix with elements hmq(t) denoting
the channel impulse response from transmitting antenna q ∈Q
to receiving antenna m ∈M, with Q and M respectively
denoting the sets of the transmitting and receiving antenna
indices as similarly deﬁned in Section II-A; L denotes the
total number of signiﬁcant multi-paths, which is usually small
due to the multi-path sparsity in mmWave channels [5]; αl
and τl denote the complex-valued path gain and the delay
for the lth path, respectively; φR,l and φT,l are the azimuth
AoA and AoD for path l, respectively; and aR ∈CM×1 and
aT ∈CQ×1 represent the array response vectors for the lens
antenna arrays at the receiver and the transmitter, respectively.
Note that in (3), we have assumed that the distances between
the scatterers and the transmitter/receiver are much larger than
the array dimensions, so that each multi-path signal can be
well approximated as a uniform plane wave.

5
Denote by AT and AR the effective lens apertures, and ˜DT
and ˜DR the lens’s effective azimuth dimensions at the trans-
mitter and at the receiver, respectively. Based on Lemma 1,
the elements in the receive and transmit array response vectors
aR and aT can be respectively expressed as
aR,m(φR,l) =
p
ARsinc(m −˜DR ˜φR,l), m ∈M,
(4)
aT,q(φT,l) =

(5)
where ˜φR,l
≜
sin(φR,l) and ˜φT,l
≜
sin(φT,l) are the
AoA/AoD spatial frequencies of the lth path. Without loss
of generality, ˜φR,l, ˜φT,l ∈[−1, 1] of the L multi-paths can
be expressed in terms of the spatial frequency resolutions
associated with the receiving/transmitting arrays as
˜φR,l = ml + ϵR,l
˜DR
, ˜φT,l = ql + ϵT,l
˜DT
, l = 1, · · · , L,
(6)
where ml ∈M and ql ∈Q are integers given by ml =
round(˜φR,l ˜DR) and ql = round(˜φT,l ˜DT ); and ϵR,l and ϵT,l
are fractional numbers in the interval [−1/2, 1/2]. Intuitively,
ml (or ql) in (6) gives the receiving (transmitting) antenna
index that is nearest to the focusing point corresponding to the
AoA (AoD) of the lth path; whereas ϵR,l and ϵT,l represent
the misalignment from the exact focusing point of the lth path
signal relative to its nearest receiving/transmitting antenna. By
substituting (6) into (4) and (5), the channel impulse response
in (3) can be equivalently expressed as
hmq(t) =
L
X
l=1
αl
p
ARAT sinc(m −ml −ϵR,l)
× sinc(q −ql −ϵT,l)δ(t −τl), m ∈M, q ∈Q.
(7)
Loosely speaking, (7) implies that the signal sent by the
transmitting antenna with index q = ql will be directed towards
the receiver mainly along the lth path, and be mainly focused
on the receiving antenna with index m = ml, as illustrated in
Fig. 3.
With the channel impulse response matrix H(t) given in
(3), the baseband equivalent signal received by the receiving
lens antenna array can be expressed as
r(t) = H(t) ⊛x(t) + z(t)
=

l=1
αlaR(φR,l)aH

where x(t) ∈CQ×1 denotes the signal sent from the Q
transmitting antennas, and z(t)

AWGN vector at the receiving antenna array. In the special
case of narrow-band communications where the maximum
excessive delay of the multi-path signals is much smaller than
the symbol duration Ts, i.e., max
l̸=l′ |τl −τl′| ≪Ts ≈1/W
with W denoting the signal bandwidth, we have τl ≈τ and
x(t−τl) ≈x(t−τ), ∀l. As a result, by assuming perfect time
synchronization at the receiver, the general signal model for
the wide-band communications in (8) reduces to
r(t) = Hx(t) + z(t),

where H = PL

Array
As a benchmark system for comparison, we consider the
mmWave communications in the traditional MIMO setup
employing conventional antenna arrays without the EM lens.
In particular, we assume that the transmitter and the receiver
are both equipped with the UPAs with QU and MU elements,
respectively, with adjacent elements separated by distance
dU = 0.5λ. For fair comparison, we assume that QU and
MU are designed such that the UPA has the same physical
dimensions (or equivalently the same effective apertures AT
and AR) as the lens antenna of interest, as illustrated in Fig. 4.
Accordingly, it can be obtained that QU = DyDz/d2
U =
4AT > Q and MU = 4AR > M, i.e., in general more
antennas need to be deployed in the conventional UPA than
that in the lens antenna array to achieve the same array
aperture, since the energy focusing capability of the EM lens
effectively reduces the number of antenna elements required
in lens array. This may compensate the additional cost of
EM lens production and integration in practice. Denote by

be similarly obtained as in (8) and (9), respectively, and are

due to the multi-path sparsity in mmWave channels [5]; αl

Denote by AT and AR the effective lens apertures, and ˜DT

the elements in the receive and transmit array response vectors

be expressed in terms of the spatial frequency resolutions
associated with the receiving/transmitting arrays as

are fractional numbers in the interval [−1/2, 1/2]. Intuitively,
ml (or ql) in (6) gives the receiving (transmitting) antenna
index that is nearest to the focusing point corresponding to the
AoA (AoD) of the lth path; whereas ϵR,l and ϵT,l represent
the misalignment from the exact focusing point of the lth path

placed on the y-z plane and centered at the origin, as shown
in Fig. 1. By considering only the azimuth AoAs and AoDs,2
the array elements are assumed to be placed on the focal
arc of the lens, which is deﬁned as a semi-circle around the
lens’s center in the azimuth plane (i.e., x-y plane shown in
Fig. 1) with radius F, where F is known as the focal length of
the lens. Therefore, the antenna locations relative to the lens
center can be parameterized as Bm(xm = F cos θm, ym =
−F sin θm, zm = 0), where θm ∈[−π/2, π/2] is the angle of
the mth antenna element relative to the x-axis, m ∈M, with
M ≜{0, ±1, · · · , ±(M −1)/2} denoting the set of antenna
indices and M representing the total number of antennas.
Note that we have assumed that M is an odd number for
convenience. Furthermore, we assume the so-called critical
antenna spacing, i.e., the antenna elements are deployed on
the focal arc so that {˜θm ≜sin θm} are equally spaced in the
interval [−1, 1] as
˜θm = m
˜D
, m ∈M,
(1)
where ˜D ≜Dy/λ is the effective lens dimension along the az-
imuth plane, with λ denoting the carrier wavelength. It follows
from (1) that M and ˜D are related via M = 1 + ⌊2 ˜D⌋, i.e.,
more antennas should be deployed for larger lens dimension
˜D. It is worth mentioning that with the array conﬁguration
speciﬁed in (1), antennas are more densely deployed in the
center of the array than those on each of the two edges.
We ﬁrst study the receive array response by assuming that
the lens antenna array is illuminated by a uniform plane
wave with AoA φ, as shown in Fig. 1. Denote by x0(φ) the
impinging signal at the reference point (say, the lens center)
on the lens aperture, and rm(φ) the resulting signal received
by the mth element of the antenna array, m ∈M. The array
response vector a(φ) ∈CM×1, whose elements are deﬁned
by the ratio am(φ) ≜rm(φ)/x0(φ), can then be obtained in
the following lemma.
2For simplicity, we assume that the elevation AoAs/AoDs are all zeros,
which is practically valid if the height difference between the transmitter and
the receiver is much smaller than their separation distance.

Fig. 1: The schematic diagram of a lens antenna array with
an incident uniform plane wave with AoA φ.
Lemma 1: For the lens antenna array with critical antenna
spacing as speciﬁed in (1), the receive array response vector
a(φ) as a function of the AoA φ is given by
am(φ) =
√
Asinc(m −˜D ˜φ), m ∈M,
(2)
where A ≜DyDz/λ2 is the effective aperture of the EM lens,
and ˜φ ≜sin φ ∈[−1, 1] is referred to as the spatial frequency
corresponding to the AoA φ.
Proof: Please refer to Appendix A.
Different from the traditional antenna arrays without lens,
whose array responses are generally given by the simple phase
shifting across different antenna elements (see e.g. (11) for
the case of UPAs), the “sinc”-function array response in (2)
demonstrates the AoA-dependent energy-focusing capability
of the lens antenna arrays, which is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Speciﬁcally, for any incident signal with a given AoA φ, the
received power is magniﬁed by approximately A times for
the receiving antenna located in the close vicinity of the focal
point ˜D ˜φ; whereas it is almost negligible for those antennas
located far away from the focal point, i.e., antennas with
|m −˜D ˜φ| ≫1. As a result, any two simultaneously received
signals with sufﬁciently different AoAs φ and φ′ such that
|˜φ −˜φ′| ≥1/ ˜D can be effectively separated in the spatial
domain, as illustrated in Fig. 2 assuming a lens antenna array
with A = 100 and ˜D = 10 for two AoAs with sin φ = 0
and 0.18, respectively. Thus, we term the quantity 1/ ˜D as the
array’s spatial frequency resolution, or approximately the AoA
resolution for large ˜D [27].
On the other hand, since the EM lens is a passive device,
reciprocity holds between the incoming and outgoing signals
through it. As a result, the transmit response vector for steering
a signal towards the AoD φ can be similarly obtained by
Lemma 1.
B. Channel Model for MmWave Lens MIMO
In this subsection, we present the channel model for the
mmWave lens MIMO system, where both the transmitter and

ment.
receiver are equipped with lens antenna arrays with Q and M
elements, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. Under the general
multi-path environment, the channel impulse response can be
modeled as
H(t) =
L
X
l=1
αlaR(φR,l)aH
T (φT,l)δ(t −τl),
(3)
where H(t) is an M×Q matrix with elements hmq(t) denoting
the channel impulse response from transmitting antenna q ∈Q
to receiving antenna m ∈M, with Q and M respectively
denoting the sets of the transmitting and receiving antenna
indices as similarly deﬁned in Section II-A; L denotes the
total number of signiﬁcant multi-paths, which is usually small
due to the multi-path sparsity in mmWave channels [5]; αl
and τl denote the complex-valued path gain and the delay
for the lth path, respectively; φR,l and φT,l are the azimuth
AoA and AoD for path l, respectively; and aR ∈CM×1 and
aT ∈CQ×1 represent the array response vectors for the lens
antenna arrays at the receiver and the transmitter, respectively.
Note that in (3), we have assumed that the distances between
the scatterers and the transmitter/receiver are much larger than
the array dimensions, so that each multi-path signal can be
well approximated as a uniform plane wave.

5
Denote by AT and AR the effective lens apertures, and ˜DT
and ˜DR the lens’s effective azimuth dimensions at the trans-
mitter and at the receiver, respectively. Based on Lemma 1,
the elements in the receive and transmit array response vectors
aR and aT can be respectively expressed as
aR,m(φR,l) =
p
ARsinc(m −˜DR ˜φR,l), m ∈M,
(4)
aT,q(φT,l) =

AT sinc(q −˜DT ˜φT,l), q ∈Q,
(5)
where ˜φR,l
≜
sin(φR,l) and ˜φT,l
≜
sin(φT,l) are the
AoA/AoD spatial frequencies of the lth path. Without loss
of generality, ˜φR,l, ˜φT,l ∈[−1, 1] of the L multi-paths can
be expressed in terms of the spatial frequency resolutions
associated with the receiving/transmitting arrays as
˜φR,l = ml + ϵR,l
˜DR
, ˜φT,l = ql + ϵT,l
˜DT
, l = 1, · · · , L,
(6)
where ml ∈M and ql ∈Q are integers given by ml =
round(˜φR,l ˜DR) and ql = round(˜φT,l ˜DT ); and ϵR,l and ϵT,l
are fractional numbers in the interval [−1/2, 1/2]. Intuitively,
ml (or ql) in (6) gives the receiving (transmitting) antenna
index that is nearest to the focusing point corresponding to the
AoA (AoD) of the lth path; whereas ϵR,l and ϵT,l represent
the misalignment from the exact focusing point of the lth path
signal relative to its nearest receiving/transmitting antenna. By
substituting (6) into (4) and (5), the channel impulse response
in (3) can be equivalently expressed as
hmq(t) =
L
X
l=1
αl
p
ARAT sinc(m −ml −ϵR,l)
× sinc(q −ql −ϵT,l)δ(t −τl), m ∈M, q ∈Q.
(7)
Loosely speaking, (7) implies that the signal sent by the
transmitting antenna with index q = ql will be directed towards
the receiver mainly along the lth path, and be mainly focused
on the receiving antenna with index m = ml, as illustrated in
Fig. 3.
With the channel impulse response matrix H(t) given in
(3), the baseband equivalent signal received by the receiving
lens antenna array can be expressed as
r(t) = H(t) ⊛x(t) + z(t)
=
L
X
l=1
αlaR(φR,l)aH
T (φT,l)x(t −τl) + z(t),
(8)
where x(t) ∈CQ×1 denotes the signal sent from the Q
transmitting antennas, and z(t)
∈
CM×1 represents the
AWGN vector at the receiving antenna array. In the special
case of narrow-band communications where the maximum
excessive delay of the multi-path signals is much smaller than
the symbol duration Ts, i.e., max
l̸=l′ |τl −τl′| ≪Ts ≈1/W
with W denoting the signal bandwidth, we have τl ≈τ and
x(t−τl) ≈x(t−τ), ∀l. As a result, by assuming perfect time
synchronization at the receiver, the general signal model for
the wide-band communications in (8) reduces to
r(t) = Hx(t) + z(t),
(9)
where H = PL

Array
As a benchmark system for comparison, we consider the
mmWave communications in the traditional MIMO setup
employing conventional antenna arrays without the EM lens.
In particular, we assume that the transmitter and the receiver
are both equipped with the UPAs with QU and MU elements,
respectively, with adjacent elements separated by distance
dU = 0.5λ. For fair comparison, we assume that QU and
MU are designed such that the UPA has the same physical
dimensions (or equivalently the same effective apertures AT
and AR) as the lens antenna of interest, as illustrated in Fig. 4.
Accordingly, it can be obtained that QU = DyDz/d2
U =
4AT > Q and MU = 4AR > M, i.e., in general more
antennas need to be deployed in the conventional UPA than
that in the lens antenna array to achieve the same array
aperture, since the energy focusing capability of the EM lens
effectively reduces the number of antenna elements required
in lens array. This may compensate the additional cost of
EM lens production and integration in practice. Denote by

Denote by AT and AR the effective lens apertures, and ˜DT

ml (or ql) in (6) gives the receiving (transmitting) antenna
index that is nearest to the focusing point corresponding to the
AoA (AoD) of the lth path; whereas ϵR,l and ϵT,l represent
the misalignment from the exact focusing point of the lth path

lens MIMO and the benchmark UPA-based MIMO systems.
III. LENS MIMO UNDER IDEAL AOAS AND AODS
To demonstrate the fundamental gains of the lens MIMO
based mmWave communication, we ﬁrst consider an “ideal”
multi-path propagation environment, where the spatial fre-
quencies {˜φR,l, ˜φT,l}L
l=1 corresponding to the AoAs/AoDs
of the L paths are all integer multiples of the spatial fre-
quency resolutions of the receiving/transmitting lenses, i.e.,
{ϵR,l, ϵT,l}L
l=1 deﬁned in (6) are all zeros. Furthermore, we
assume that all the L signal paths have distinct AoAs/AoDs
such that ml′ ̸= ml and ql′ ̸= ql, ∀l′ ̸= l. In this case,
we show that the multi-path signals in the lens antenna
enabled mmWave MIMO system can be perfectly resolved
in the spatial domain, thus leading to a new and capacity-
achieving spatial multiplexing technique called OPDM. We
also show that with OPDM, the lens antenna based mmWave
MIMO system achieves the same (or even better) capacity
performance in the narrow-band (wide-band) communications
as compared to the conventional UPA based mmWave MIMO,
but with dramatically reduced signal processing complexity
and RF chain cost.
A. Orthogonal Path Division Multiplexing
In the “ideal” AoA/AoD environment as deﬁned above, the
channel impulse response from the transmitting antenna q to
receiving antenna m given in (7) reduces to
hmq(t) =
L
X
l=1
αl
p
ARAT δ(m −ml)δ(q −ql)δ(t −τl).
(13)
The expression in (13) implies that the signal transmitted
by antenna q will be received at antenna m if and only if
there exists a propagation path such that the focusing points
corresponding to its AoA and AoD align exactly with the
locations of antenna m and q, respectively, i.e., m = ml and
Fig. 5: Equivalent input-output relationship for OPDM.
q = ql. Denote by xq(t) the signal sent by antenna q of the
transmitting lens array, where q ∈Q. The signal received by
antenna m (by ignoring additive noise for the time being) can
then be expressed as
rm(t) =
X
q∈Q
hmq(t) ⊛xq(t)
=
(√ARAT αlxql(t −τl),
if m = ml for some l,
0,
otherwise.
(14)
Under the assumption of perfect time synchronization at each
of the receiving antennas, i.e., τl is known at the receiver and
perfectly compensated at antenna ml, (14) can be equivalently
written as
rml =
p
ARAT αlxql + zml, l = 1, · · · , L,
(15)
where zml denotes the AWGN at receiving antenna ml.
Therefore, the original multi-path MIMO channel has been
decoupled into L parallel SISO AWGN channels, each cor-
responding to one of the L multi-paths. It is worth men-
tioning that the channel

the input-output relationship in (8) then reduces to

vectors of aT and x corresponding to the transmitting antennas
in QS, respectively.
Remark 1: It follows from (21) that for mmWave lens
MIMO system with arbitrary AoAs/AoDs, only |MS| ≪M
receiving and |QS| ≪Q transmitting RF chains are generally
needed to achieve the near-optimal performance of the full-
MIMO system with all M + Q antennas/RF chains in use.
Furthermore, since |MS| ≤PL
l=1 |Ml| ≈2∆L, and |QS| ≤
PL
l=1 |Ql| ≈2∆L, the total number of RF chains required
only depends on the number of multi-paths L, instead of the
actually deployed antennas M and Q.
A. Transceiver Design Based on PDM
In this subsection, by exploiting the reduced-size channel
matrix in (21), we propose a low-complexity transceiver
design based on PDM (instead of OPDM due to arbitrary
AoAs/AoDs), which is applicable for both narrow-band and
wide-band mmWave communications. With PDM, L indepen-
dent data streams are transmitted in general, each through
one of the L multi-paths by transmit beamforming/precoding.
Speciﬁcally, the discrete-time equivalent of the transmitted
signal xQS(t) can be expressed as

beamforming vector towards the AoD φT,l of path l. Note that
we have used the identity ∥aT,QS(φT,l)∥2 ≈∥aT (φT,l)∥2 =
AT , ∀l. At the receiver side, the low-complexity per-stream
based detection is used, where a receiving beamforming vector
vl ∈C|MS|×1 with ∥vl∥= 1 is applied over the receiving
antennas in MS for detecting sl[n]. Thus, we have

Next, we analyze the performance of the above proposed
PDM scheme for wide-band communications. The analysis
for the special case of narrow-band communications can
be obtained similarly and is thus omitted for brevity. For
simplicity, we assume that the multi-path delays can be ap-
proximated as integer multiples of the symb
