ip DRA designs, such as 
small and in-substrate DRAs, have become more and more popular. The reason behind this increase in demand is 
the swift advancement of economical methods for producing multilayer laminates, like Low-Temperature Co-fired 
Ceramic (LTCC) and Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) [9]. Regardless of the application 6G supports, RF (Radio Frequency) 
transceivers are inevitable part of a 6G architecture. A generic RF MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) transceiver 
is shown in the Fig. 1. This generic RF MIMO transceiver architecture included a phase shifter at its transmitter and 
its receiver. This is because to accurately capture the transmitted signal, phase shifts are necessary to align the array 
beam with the direction from which the received signal arrives [10]. It should be noted that the input to the RF 
transmitter and the output from the RF receiver are not depicted in Fig. 1, as the main emphasis of this review paper 
is on antenna designs rather than RF transceiver architectures.
This paper focusses on a review of the around 50 most promising 6G antenna architectures, a key component 
of RF transceivers. This paper also highlights the key characteristics of these antenna architectures and how it can 
be a considered a promising candidate for 6G applications. The 6G antenna architectures are sorted based on their 
operating frequencies: mid- and high-

structures occupies large device real estate, using 4-port MIMO antenna modules makes the antenna low profile to support eight spatial streams with the ηs of 56 bps/Hz. Simulation of this structure reveals that the antenna resonates at approximately 7.3 and 8.3 GHz with a 3:1 VSWR, a common standard for mobile antennas. These results are attributed to the antenna structure: four square top sub patches with truncated inner corners are printed on a FR4 substrate, separated by a layer of air.

ch antenna for UWB and 6G applications To provide reliable 6G networks in urban areas, higher data capacity is required, and the frequency of interest that can achieve this desired outcome is centimetric waves. The centimetric wave bands are also referred as mid-band 6G spectrum that pans from 7–20 GHz will be one of the promising frequency bands that can provide a robust coverage in urban areas. The ideal antenna candidate to meet these requirements are patch antennas because they are easy Fig. 3   Geometry of the low-profile four-port MIMO (4PM) antenna module. a Top and side views. b Perspective view [12]

This paper uses FFF to fabricate patch antenna that can be integrated to a wearable ring and a Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA). The advantages of using this fabrication methodology are to keep the fabrication cost down. The fabricated patch antenna was measured in free space using a hand phantom.

In the third iteration, a circular groove was added to the left and right of the central symmetry of the antenna. This moved the resonant frequency to 217 GHz and 228 GHz with gain of 3.7 dB and 4.5 dB, relatively. The inclusion of a circular groove expanded the operating bandwidth to 33 GHz, resulting in a relative bandwidth for the structure of 41.25%.

ess technology is anticipated to become a reality. [1, 2].To make this technology a reality, engineers, governments, international bodies are actively investing in research to make this promise a reality. Although the 6G technology is built on the foundation of fifth generation (5G) and 5G advanced, 6G technology is expected to provide a higher spectral efficiency, very low latency, optimal AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) connectivity, and higher data coverage than 5G. Some notable applications include extended virtual reality (XR), digital twins, and holographic communications. Essentially, it is anticipated that 6G technology would close the gap between the digital and real worlds. To support these applications, you need enabling technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), AI, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), ultra massive MIMO and more. The main challenge for WPT is the sharp decline in energy transfer efficiency with distance due to considerable route loss.

ntenna array, a patch antenna that resembles like a stacked square-ring is selected for its filtering capability, simple design, and low cost. The stacked square antenna con-sists of two square rings that are stacked on each other to increase the operating bandwidth and decrease the ­Zin. The radiation pattern is notably wide, exhibiting a peak directivity perpendicular to the antenna’s plane and null directions parallel to the ground plane. This element is extended to an 8-by-8 array comprising of 64 elements and this array reso-nates at 19.5 GHz and 29.5 GHz with the directivity of 23.3 dBi at 30° scanning. The paper discusses that if 8-by-8 array is extended to 64-by-64 antenna array, then the directivity and gain can be improved.2.6  Sandwiched PRS Fabry–Perot antennaSince 6G RF architecture demands a compact PCB real estate, the choice Fabry–Perot (FP) antennas come to mind. FP antennas are favored in wireless communications for their high gain characteristics, though this high gain comes at a cost of larger cavity height.

Figure 5 shows (a) Top view and (b) bottom view of the glass shaped antenna.This structure is fed through a microstrip quarter wave transformer for impedance matching purposes.

### Section 2: Mid-frequency 6G antenna architectures (extracted)


2  Mid‑frequency 6G antenna architectures
Table 1. Presents a summary of the key characteristics of mid-frequency 6G antennas as documented in recent publications.
2.1  8‑Port MIMO antenna module
The antenna discussed in [11] operates within the 6 GHz frequency bands, and it has been shown that using MIMO with eight spatial streams, it can attain a spectral efficiency exceeding 56 bps/Hz. Figure 2 shows the geometry of the 1 × 2 module array with two eight-port multiple-input and multiple-output (8PM) antenna modules mounted on a ground plane. (a) Top (b) side view (c) Back view. This antenna is an 8PM antenna module designed to provide eight uncorrelated waves operating in the 6.425–7.125 GHz range using four patch antennas. These patch antennas feature dual polariza-tion, and the entire module is designed to be compact, with each antenna element taking up just 0.074λ2 of area. The antenna has been extended to a 1-by-2 8PM configuration and tested to provide up to 10 Gbps data throughput with 200 MHz bandwidth, thereby enabling a spectral efficiency (ηs) exceeding 56 bps/Hz. This achieved ηs is thrice than that of a 4-by-4 MIMO for 5G operation at 3.5 GHz. The ports 1–8 of the 8PM antennas are excited to generate eight uncorre-lated waves at the desired frequency bands. Port isolation is achieved by adding a shorted disk in the four dual-polarized antennas, which slightly diverts the surface currents. This antenna has been applied to a 16-by-8 MIMO test bed system 
and measured for its bit error rate, throughput, spectral efficiency, and Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR). The results obtained from these measurements are summarized in [11].

2.2  4‑port MIMO antenna module
6G devices are anticipated to support more MIMO spatial streams than their 5G counterparts. As a result, this antenna is targeted to operate in 7.025–8.4 GHz to achieve larger spectral efficiency. Figure 3 shows geometry of the low-profile four-port MIMO (4PM) antenna module. (a) Top and side views. (b) Perspective view. The antenna [12] is constructed using 4PM antenna modules that forms 16-port closely spaced 2-by-2 module array. Since 16-port structures occupies large device real estate, using 4-port MIMO antenna modules makes the antenna low profile to support eight spatial streams with the ηs of 56 bps/Hz. Simulation of this structure reveals that the antenna resonates at approximately 7.3 and 8.3 GHz with a 3:1 VSWR, a common standard for mobile antennas. These results are attributed to the antenna struc-ture: four square top sub patches with truncated inner corners are printed on a FR4 substrate, separated by a layer of air.

2.3  Planar lens antenna for X‑band 6G applications
High-gain antennas are in demand when it comes to compensate free space path loss in higher operating frequen-cies. This is applicable in sensing and massive MIMO systems [13, 14]. Massive MIMO systems can employ EM lens 
with large antenna array to tap into benefits of energy focussing and spatial interference rejection [15, 16]. The Lens antenna array focus signals into distinct paths i.e. focus energy based on Angle of Arrival (AoA) of signals reducing the need for multiple RF chains [17, 18].
The contour map of the power of the signals received by various lens array elements for signals coming at (θ, φ) = (0,0) and (0, –15°), respectively, is displayed in Figure 4. The experimental verification confirms that the energy focusing antennas of lens arrays fluctuate with the orientations of the signals when a signal arrives at a different direction (θ, φ) = (0, –15°). These antennas are relocated to those with indices around (3, 4). In [19], a novel design is suggested to enhance antenna gain through a single-layer metasurface comprising several circular metal patches combined with rectangular slots. These slots determine polarization of antenna. This paper also compares non-resonant and resonant planar lens antenna designs. The non-resonant planar lens antennas require high permittivity materials which makes fabrication unfeasible. But using metasurfaces, one can design a high gain planar antennas without high permittivity materials. The shape of the planar lens is optimized to achieve an increased gain for a single patch antenna, which rises from 7.2 dBi to 16 dBi at 10 GHz and reaches 12.8 dBi at 10.4 GHz within the X-band spectrum. This eliminates the necessity for an array feeding network, thereby reducing losses generated by feed. These factors contributed to high gain planar structures.

2.4  Glass shaped patch antenna for UWB and 6G applications
To provide reliable 6G networks in urban areas, higher data capacity is required, and the frequency of interest that can achieve this desired outcome is centimetric waves. The centimetric wave bands are also referred as mid-band 6G spectrum that pans from 7–20 GHz will be one of the promising frequency bands that can provide a robust coverage in urban areas. The ideal antenna candidate to meet these requirements are patch antennas because they are easy

to integrate in a PCB [20]. The patch in [20] is form of a glass to enhance the bandwidth. Figure 5 shows (a) Top view and (b) bottom view of the glass shaped antenna.This structure is fed through a microstrip quarter wave transformer for impedance matching purposes. The ground plane is also etched with a semi-circular is etched to further enhance the impedance bandwidth. This configuration provides an UWB antenna that operates between 2.69–20.05 GHz with a fractional bandwidth of 152.68% and a VSWR < 2 for the entire operating frequency band.

2.5  Slotted stacked patch antenna array for 6G satellite mobile communication systems
Another antenna candidate discussed in [21] is used to increase the data capacity is active antenna array. The frequency of interest that was chosen is in K/Ka band and this antenna array is targeted to provide beam steering patterns for 6G TX/RX satellite mobile communication systems. Figure 6 shows the 3D view of the square-ring patch 8 × 8 sub-antenna. The first step in designing this antenna is to calculate the link budget of a satellite link and determine its gain. The antenna gain has been found to be a minimum of 35 dB. The next step in the active antenna design process is choosing an ideal candidate for antenna element that meet the requirements. The filtering antennas or filtennas are chosen because they do not require additional filtering systems. For an element in the antenna array, a patch antenna that resembles like a stacked square-ring is selected for its filtering capability, simple design, and low cost. The stacked square antenna con-sists of two square rings that are stacked on each other to increase the operating bandwidth and decrease the ­Zin. The 
radiation pattern is notably wide, exhibiting a peak directivity perpendicular to the antenna’s plane and null directions parallel to the ground plane. This element is extended to an 8-by-8 array comprising of 64 elements and this array reso-nates at 19.5 GHz and 29.5 GHz with the directivity of 23.3 dBi at 30° scanning. The paper discusses that if 8-by-8 array is extended to 64-by-64 antenna array, then the directivity and gain can be improved.

2.6  Sandwiched PRS Fabry–Perot antenna
Since 6G RF architecture demands a compact PCB real estate, the choice Fabry–Perot (FP) antennas come to mind. FP antennas are favored in wireless communications for their high gain characteristics, though this high gain comes at a cost of larger cavity height. Figure 7 shows the (a) Side view of the FP antenna, (b) geometry of the slit radiator. The FP antenna architecture incudes a substrate, Partially Reflective Surfaces (PRS), and one or more superstrates.The distance between substrate and superstrate, cavity height, is expected to be λ/2 for optimal Aperture Efficiency (AE). But with demand of compact RF architecture, the antenna in [22] proposes a novel idea in reducing the cavity height up to λ/17 without compromising AE. The lower cavity height is achieved by sandwiching PRS between two superstrates. This aided in reducing the cavity height. The prototype antenna resonates at 25.3 GHz with AE of 79.4% and a gain of 12.35 dBi. Due to these simulated results, it makes a promising 6G antenna candidate.

2.7  Wearable ring metal‑dielectric and DR antennas
The demand of light-weight antennas in 6G communications motivated to design antennas that are light-weight and economical to fabricate. Figure 8 shows the Patch antenna integrated into a wearable ring (a) top view, (b) side view .To do this, the paper [23] introduces Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) to fabricate antennas. FFF uses an in-house machine to fabricate metal-dielectric antennas thus 3-D printing of metal and the substrate layer. This paper uses FFF to fabricate patch antenna that can be integrated to a wearable ring and a Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA). The advantages of using this fabrication methodology are to keep the fabrication cost down. The fabricated patch antenna was measured in free space using a hand phantom. This antenna resonated around 28 GHz with 0.6 GHz of impedance bandwidth. This Fig. 6   A 3D view of the square-ring patch 8 × 8 sub-antenna [21]

Perspective paper also discusses about fabrication of DRA to emphasis the future scope of fabricating future 6G antennas. The DRA resonates at 13.5 GHz and 0.5 GHz impedance bandwidth with the radiation gain above 6 GHz.

2.8  Wideband Antenna‑in‑Package
The Antenna-in-Package (AiP) is commonly used in 60 GHz and above applications. The AiP are cost effective and make the antennas compact. This also means that antenna and RF systems share very small physical distance in PCBs, and this produces EM interference. The EM interference is introduced by common mode currents and common mode sup-pression techniques in PCBs are very hard to achieve due to small coupling distance, high permittivity of the material, etc., To overcome the challenges, a low-cost antenna AiP antenna is designed in [24] with wideband common-mode chocking characteristics. Figure 9 shows the evolution of the proposed antenna. (a) Wideband, High-Efficiency Electro-magnetic Structure (WHEMS) with a back plate and metal backing cavity. (b) Ideal model of the proposed antenna. (c) AiP implementation of the proposed antenna in PCB technology. The antenna is a WHEMS featuring a backing cavity. Within this cavity, an enhanced quarter wave transformer, known as a radiating choke, is embedded. This choke effectively

suppresses both common-mode and radiation currents. The structure demonstrates a 22% impedance bandwidth rang-ing from 60-75 GHz, with a gain of 8–10 dBi.

2.9  mm‑wave conical‑beam antenna
Another compact antenna is discussed in [25] which is targeted for mm-wave low-earth orbit (LEO) systems. Figure 10 shows the Proposed ME CB antenna.This antenna is a conical-beam (CB) antenna that operates in E-band (71–86 GHz). Compared to the existing CB antennas this antenna has a high gain of 12.05 dBi at 76 GHz and wideband planar antenna with an impedance bandwidth of 40.9% (59.38–89.95 GHz). The high-gain and wideband characteristics of this antenna is achieved by the probe excitation of electric and magnetic dipoles. The realization of these electric dipoles takes the shape of two annular rings divided into eight annular sectors. And the magnetic dipoles are realized by five vias that are drilled into each annular sector. But this single layer structure has a constraint on the feeding design and imposed a limit on the number of elements. This resulted in poor conical radiation. To generate a good conical radiation a multi-stage circular-cavity substrate integrated waveguide structure is designed and that helped to control the ­TM010/TM020 resonant modes.

2.10  Tooth‑shaped antenna
The 76–81 GHz frequency band is used for Autonomous Vehicle Applications (AVA) and the RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) systems that are designed to aid the AVA applications to understand the surrounding environments. To do this, these applications require high gain antennas with a broad field view and a narrow beam in azimuth and elevation direction. Figure 11 shows the Tooth-shaped patch antenna. The paper [26] compares a conventional insert-fed patch antenna and how its performance can be improved by using eight equally spaced tooth-shaped slots and two slots at the lower edge of the antenna. Because of its true input admittance, the tooth-shaped antenna design makes it ideal for use in both Long-Range Radar (LRR) and Short-Range Radar (SRR) applications. It resonates at 77 GHz, offering a gain

### Section 3: High-frequency band 6G antennas (extracted)


3  High‑frequency band 6G antennas
Table 2 presents a summary of the key characteristics of high frequency 6G antennas as documented in recent publications.

3.1  110 GHz antenna array module using AiP
Sub-Terahertz (Sub-THz) frequencies are one of the promising frequency bands in 6G communications. This is primary because we can optimize our systems for high data rate. Due to the small wavelength in Sub-THz frequencies, AiPs are best suited to realize antenna array module. In this paper [27], a 110 GHz antenna array module was realized in AiP. At Sub-THz, AiP radiation performance will vary because most System-in-Package (SiP) fabrication processes have been designed for packaging low frequency RF systems. Conventional SIP architectures employs even substrates in total: A core substrate with thicker thickness for mechanical support and this core substrate is stacked with three thinner sub-strates top and bottom of the core substrate with prepreg materials. Figure 12 shows the Stacked dielectric substrates to design the Sub-THz AiP. In this paper, two AiP architectures are discussed: In this first architecture, a thicker core is used.
The thickness of the first AiP with all the layers is 850 µm. This includes ground and metal planes with metal via-pad and anti-pad. For the second architecture, a thinner core is used, and it brings down the thickness to 400 µm. In the metal layer, a rectangular metal patch radiator is placed. While simulating it is observed that the AiP with the thinner thickness produce larger bandwidth of 6.6 GHz at 110 GHz resonant frequency. When the antenna is extended to 2-by-2, 4-by-2, Fig. 11 Tooth-shaped patch antenna [26]

4-by-4, 4-by-4, 8-by-4, and 8-by-8, it is observed that the bandwidth and gain increased. For 8-by-8, the AiP exhibits a 19.65 dBi gain and 9.19 GHz bandwidth.

3.2  Substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) based slot antenna
This paper [28] also proposes a D-band (110–170 GHz) antenna that aims to provide higher data rates. The antenna is chosen to be a wideband PCB based SIW slot antenna designed. To support higher order modes, a wide cavity is selected. Figure 13 shows the Proposed antenna with WR6-SIW transition. The antenna architecture comprises of top and bottom metal layers, and they are joined to create SIW line and cavity. The two layers communicates with arrays of vias, and their dimensions are optimized to ensure that the radiation loss is less than or equal to − 0.06 dB throughout the D-band. The top metal layer is etched with a rectangular slot to support the antenna performance. Upon simulation, the antenna resonates at six different frequencies in the D-band. The modes supported by this structure are ­TE310 at 114.2 GHz and ­TE210 at 134.75 GHz. The other four resonance frequencies, identified at 124 GHz, 144 GHz, 154 GHz, and 160 GHz, result from hybrid modes. The first two are created by the merging of ­TE310–TE120 and ­TE120–TE220 modes, respectively, while the last two originate from the combination of ­TE220–TE320 modes.

3.3  Leaky wave wire antenna
The antenna in [29] is a leaky wave wire antenna which is also another D-band antenna that operates at 120 GHz with a simulated gain of 9.9 dBi. Figure 14 shows the Leaky Wave Antenna. The design of the antenna features four metal wires wrapped around a Teflon rod, with each wire being twisted at a rate of 520°. This antenna architecture is simple and does not require tedious fabrication process. However, this paper does not cover feeding mechanisms for exciting this antenna, as designing and selecting optimal feeding mechanisms for these architectures poses significant challenges. If properly excited, this architecture can be used for 6G communications.

3.4  Stacked patch 4‑by‑4 antenna array
The antenna in [30] is a stacked patch 4-by-4 antenna array that was built to target data-intensive 6G applications includ-ing driver-less vehicles, extended reality, and broadband plus. To support 100 GB/s application, the antenna must sup-port at least of 25 GHz bandwidth. Figure 15 shows the D-band stacked patch antenna design. (a) PCB stack-up (CORE:

Perspective core substrate. PP: prepreg). (b) Exploded view. (c) Top view and physical parameters of antenna structure. The proposed design consists of six conductor layers. In these six layers, the ground plane, microstrip feeding network, top and bot-tom patches can be found. Two ground layers with no connection are placed between the top and bottom patches to construct via barriers. Surface waves between each antenna element are suppressed as a result. Upon simulating a single antenna element, the structure yielded the 40 GHz bandwidth and 6.9 dBi gain. This structure is extended to 4-by-4 planar array and measured to find the resonance is at 140 GHz featuring a 35 GHz bandwidth that spans from 123–158 GHz, along with a gain of 17.5 dBi.

3.5  MIMO D‑band antenna array
The antenna described in [31] is another promising candidate for 6G communication. Figure 16 shows the geometry of the low profile antenna (a) top view (b) metric view.

gain of 18.3 dB and a bandwidth of 17 GHz from 142-155.5 GHz with 150 GHz being resonant frequency. The design process involves first constructing 1-by-8 MIMO patch array and each element of this patch array is cascaded using series feed. After constructing 1-by-8 array, an 8-by-8 array is formed with 8 elements of 1-by-8 array. The 8-by-8 array is connected using a 50 Ω 1-to-8 Wilkinson power divider. By connecting the antenna in this configuration, the antenna provided a wider bandwidth which will allow this antenna to transmit signals at higher data rates.

3.6  Symmetrical multi slot THz microstrip antenna
The antenna described in [32] features a silicon substrate with a butterfly-shaped radiation arm that is symmetrical from left to right, and it utilizes a lumped port for excitation. Figure 17 shows the Antenna 3 and specific structure of “loop” patch. The antenna is constructed in multiple iterations to improve the performance and support 6G com-munication requirements. In the first iteration, the antenna resembles a traditional bow tie with slots. In addition to this, a circular and semi-circular patch was etched at the symmetry and two ends of the radiation arms, respectively.
The antenna upon simulation reveals that it resonates at 228 GHz and 243 GHz with the 31.4 GHz operating band-width and 7.44 dB gain. To further improve the performance, in the second iteration, a vertical rectangular slot is cut into the center of the structure. This improved the current distribution, operating bandwidth, and gain. In the third iteration, a circular groove was added to the left and right of the central symmetry of the antenna. This moved the resonant frequency to 217 GHz and 228 GHz with gain of 3.7 dB and 4.5 dB, relatively. The inclusion of a circular groove expanded the operating bandwidth to 33 GHz, resulting in a relative bandwidth for the structure of 41.25%.

3.7  Circularly polarized Sub‑THz four‑layer antenna The antenna designed in [33] operates in sub-THz frequency region to combat high atmospheric attenuation, and to support high data rates and large bandwidths. However, in sub-THz band, using a relatively thick substrate produces surface waves and this in turn will result in narrower bandwidth antennas. To avoid this issue, the antenna is designed using brass and it is Circularly Polarized (CP). Figure 18 shows the Exploded view of the antenna.The antenna consists of four layers: radiating window, an excitation layer, an air cavity, and a coupling layer. The radiation characteristics is like of an Air-filled Channelized Coplanar Waveguide (ACCPW) and a 300 GHz WR-3 waveguide is used to center feed the structure. The antenna offers a 12 GHz axial ratio bandwidth from 278.2–290.2 GHz, within an 8.9% impedance 
bandwidth from 270-295 GHz and boasts a gain of 11.9 dBic and 95.1% efficiency. Its compact size of 2.25λ -by- 2.25λ -by- 0.5λ at 285 GHz makes it ideal for next generation sub-THz 6G applications.

3.8  Circularly polarized horn antenna
Another CP antenna for 6G applications were discussed in [34], but this is a horn antenna. Figure 19 shows the 3-D exploded view of the antenna.This horn antenna is fabricated using the wire Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) method. Designed for operation at 300 GHz, the antenna features a WR-03 rectangular waveguide feed, a circular polarizer disk, and a conical horn. The circular polarizer is made up of crossed slots of unequal lengths, which are

perpendicular to each other. Adjusting the lengths of these slots allows for the observation of the Circular Polariza-tion (CP) radiation pattern. The antenna provides a 20% impedance bandwidth, ranging from 270 GHz to 330 GHz, with a reflection coefficient of ≤ − 15 dB. Additionally, it offers a 7 GHz axial ratio bandwidth between 309-316 GHz, achieving a minimum axial ratio of 1.15 dB at 312 GHz.

3.9  THz dipole reflector antenna
6G wireless communication is expected to operate in THz to provide higher data rate compared to 5G and other older communication standards [4]. One of the promising antenna candidate is proposed in [35]. The antenna is simple dipole with reflectors and directors that operates between 295–400 GHz with 33.8% impedance bandwidth. Figure 20 shows the Top view of the single element with a reflector .The antenna resonates at 310 GHz and uses indium phosphide and benzo-cyclo-butene as substrates. Gold is used to construct dipole, reflector, and half-circle shaped directors. The overall gain through simulation is observed to be 7.27 dBi. Although the proposed antenna features a simple design, the selec-tion of materials for its substrates and conducting layer renders it both costly and specialized.

3.10  6G Turnstile antenna
The study [36] explores a 1 THz graphene-based turnstile or crossed-dipole patch antenna, chosen for graphene’s superior properties over copper in conductivity, tensile strength, and current density at THz frequencies, making it ideal for THz 6G antennas. Graphene also enables Transverse Magnetic Surface Plasmon Polariton (TM SPP) waves. Figure 21 shows the Graphene THz Turnstile Antenna. Constructed from two graphene dipoles on an epoxy and silica substrate, electro-magnetic simulations show the antenna supports circular polarization with a 30% 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth, 0.454 dBi gain, and 69.79% efficiency. However, its low gain raises questions about its effectiveness for 6G communication.

### Section 4: Future direction (extracted)


4  Future direction
Future trends in 6G antenna designs are focused on meeting the demands of ultra-fast data rates, low-latency commu-nication, and enhanced energy efficiency [41, 42]. Here are some key trends:

Perspective

4.1  Terahertz (THz) antenna design
Massive bandwidth is available at THz frequencies, which are operated over 100 GHz using 6G antennas [43]. These extremely high frequencies will require antenna designs to be capable of handling smaller, high-gain antennas that can overcome the propagation issues associated with THz signals. Research is being done on materials like graphene and metamaterials to enable a small and effective THz antenna.

4.2  Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)
RIS is a method used to modify radio waves without the need of sophisticated signal processing algorithms or active power amplifiers [44]. Real-time wireless signal reflection and refraction on passive, tunable surfaces will be possible thanks to RIS technology. Because RIS-based antenna designs eliminate the need for high-power transmitters, 6G networks will use less energy and be more environmentally friendly.

4.3  Beamforming and beam steering enhancements
6G antenna systems will use AI and machine learning to automatically adjust beamforming. As a result, antennas will be able to automatically modify beam direction and power levels in response to network conditions, user location, and mobility patterns.
In order to reduce interference and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for more dependable communication, antenna arrays use beamforming to focus signals into particular places. While digital beamforming uses digital signal processing (DSP) to alter amplitude and phase, analog beamforming uses phase shifters to modify the phase of each antenna element. Performance and complexity can be balanced by combining the two approaches[45].In millimeter-wavelength communications, huge antenna arrays are typically installed at the transmitter and/or receiver to pro-duce massive beamforming gains in order to offset the significant route loss. For millimeter-wave communications, EM-lens enabled MIMO can be used to significantly enhance beamforming performance while lowering hardware and signal processing expenses [17].

4.4  Miniaturization and integration
Future antennas may incorporate flexible, conformal designs for better integration with devices like smartphones, wearables, and even clothing, offering greater flexibility in product design while maintaining high performance. In summary, 6G antenna designs will focus on ultra-high frequency operation, intelligent beamforming, and integra-tion with smart surfaces, all while enhancing energy efficiency and supporting next-generation wireless applications.Fig. 21   Graphene THz Turn-stile Antenna [36]

vestigated for transforming linearly polarized waves into
circularly polarized waves. Examples include the utilization
of Complementary Split-Ring Resonators (CSRRs) and U-
shaped Split-Ring Resonators (SRRs) with photonic crystal

linear polarizers based on chiral metasurfaces with asym-
metric transmission, while others have demonstrated planar
metallic metasurfaces composed of spiral elements to support
isotropic backward waves [64], [65].

Structure optimization technique: This represents the
most effective approach for enhancing the performance of
metasurface antennas by modifying their physical architec-
ture to control electromagnetic waves. Various techniques
exist to manipulate EM waves, including unit cell geometry
tuning (utilizing square, cross, and ring resonator configu-
rations) to optimize reflection and transmission properties,
defected ground structure (DGS) implementation through
Complementary Split Ring Resonators (CSRRs) to improve
bandwidth, multi-layer metasurface design employing multi-
layer stacking to enhance impedance matching and radiation
efficiency, and metamaterial superstrate placement to aug-

plications of DL in areas such as metasurface antenna design,
antenna arrays, and MIMO systems [103]–[105]. The state-
of-the-art methods across all three areas of machine learning
increasingly rely on deep learning techniques. Fig 6 illustrates
the hierarchical structure of AI, encompassing machine learn-

FIGURE 6. Structure of AI, including Machine Learning (Supervised,
Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning) and Deep Learning.
A. SUPERVISED LEARNING
Supervised learning algorithms are machine learning algo-
rithms that are trained using labeled examples. This model
defines a mapping from one or more inputs to one or more
outputs using labels as guidance. Essentially, it represents
a mathematical equation where input data passed through
this equation computes the corresponding output, a process
referred to as inference. The model equation contains param-
eters whose different values alter the computational outcome;
the model equation describes a family of possible relation-
ships between inputs and outputs, while these parameters
specify the particular relationship within that family. To make
predictions, a model f (x) is required that takes input x and
returns output y [106].
y = f [x]
(25)
The choice of parameters determines the particular relation-
ship between input and output, wh

to correctly separate examples into predefined categories or
classes. This algorithm links input features with target labels
by minimizing the error between predictions and actual la-
bels. Performance metrics are very useful when the main goal
is to compare different classification models. Several metrics
are based on the confusion matrix, which is a square table that
records the number of instances between two rates: the actual
and predicted classifications, as illustrated in Fig 7.

ts, such as smartwatches and fitness
trackers. These devices incorporate antenna-enabled sensors
that monitor vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure,
and blood oxygen levels. Machine learning algorithms can
analyze this data to detect irregularities and predict poten-
tial health issues such as atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, and
elevated stress levels [101]. Machine learning methods can
be broadly categorized into three areas: supervised, unsuper-
vised, and reinforcement learning. Fig 8 illustrates these three
types of machine learning algorithms in greater detail.
Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning that repre-
sents one of the most powerful and practical approaches in ar-
tificial intelligence. Machine learning models are frequently
encountered in daily life through various applications pow-
ered by ML, such as text translation from different languages
using natural language processing algorithms, internet image
searches for specific objects using computer vision systems,
and interactions with digital assistants via speech recognition
interfaces [102]. Several studies have surveyed emerging ap-
plications of DL in areas such as metasurface antenna design,
antenna arrays, and MIMO systems [103]–[105]. The state-
of-the-art methods across all three areas of machine learning

Sometimes the training data is non-separable. This geometry
is called non-linearly separable, as illustrated on the right of
Fig9, and can be handled using the soft-margin formulation
presented in (34). For i ∈[m], there exist slack variables
ξi ≥0. The variables ξi are known as slack variables and are
commonly used in optimization to define the relaxed version
of constraints [109].

FIGURE 9. The marginal hyperplanes represented by separable and
non-separable case.
Decision tree: A decision tree is one of the most intuitive
classifiers, being easy to understand and construct. It dissects
a dataset by reducing entropy or increasing information gain
at each node. There exist numerous decision tree algorithms,
such as the C4.5 decision tree (C4.5) [110], multi-class alter-
nating decision tree [111], NBTree decision tree (NBT) [112],
and Simple CART [113]. Decision trees can be used as weak
learners with boosting to define effective learning algorithms.
They are typically fast to train and evaluate, and relatively
easy to interpret. The primary goal of a decision tree is to
predict the value of a target feature for unseen instances based
on several input features. Depending on whether the target
feature is categorical or numerical, the decision tree may be
used for classification or regression, respectively. A classifi-
cation tree consists of a root node holding the

In the final stage, child nodes are generated with the split
feature. Fig10 illustrates an example of a decision tree.

with c distinct classes {C1, C2, . . . , Cc}. Assume that Fset =

Artificial Neural Network: Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) were first introduced in the 1940s [116] with inspi-
ration from understanding the human brain. Recently, many
researchers have paid attention to ANNs due to their flex-
ibility and powerful ability to solve real-world problems,
based on modern hardware that consists of efficient com-
putational power to perform large-scale computations [117].
ANNs can be used in different setups, including image anal-
ysis, image recognition, and natural language processing.
Also, they are capable of handling both complex and non-
complex problems in agriculture, science, medical sc

![FIGURE 11. The main differences between the perceptron and Adaline](/mnt/data/1343718_assets/Figure11_p16.png)


Adaline rule and the perceptron
is that the weights are updated based on a linear activation
function rather than a unit step function. In Adaline, this linear
activation function ϕ(z) is simply the identity function of the
net input. In mathematical terms [118].
ϕ(wTz) = wTz
(35)
While the linear activation function is used for learning the
weights, a threshold function is used to make the final pre-
diction. Fig 11 shows the differences between the perceptron
and the Adaline algorithm [119].
FIGURE 11. The main differences between the perceptron and Adaline
algorithm [119]
Regression: Regression is a learning problem where the
algorithm is interested in predicting a single real-valued num-
ber. It is a statistical technique used to predict a target variable
on a continuous scale [120]. In the field of electronics and
telecommunications, especially in antenna design, regression
can be used to optimize performance parameters such as
resonant frequency, gain, bandwidth, and reflection coeffi-
cient (S11). An example of regression would be predicting
the resonance frequency (fr) based on antenna parameters like
periodicity, unit size, and substrate properties. Models such as
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) or Polynomial Regression
can be utilized for this purpose [121].
Mean Squared Error (MSE) [122] is one common error
function used in antenna optimization to measure the differ-
ence between the predicted and actual values of the perfor-
mance metrics. The MSE is calculated

data sample are not part of the data; this kind of data is
called unlabeled data and is depicted in Fig 12 [123]. Many
studies investigate different techniques and applications of
unsupervised ML in antennas, such as antenna optimization
by dimensionality reduction [124] and antenna optimization
via clustering [125]. There exist many applications of unsu-
pervised learning algorithms, such as clustering, dimension-
ality reduction, and generative models.
FIGURE 12. Unsupervised learning, workflow of K-mean clustering
[123].
Clustering: Clustering is one of the most widely used
implementations of unsupervised learning. It involves the
automatic discovery of natural groups or clusters within unla-
beled data, whereby the degree of similarity between samples
within the same cluster is maximized, while the degree of
dissimilarity between samples from different clusters is si-
multaneously maximized. Various clustering approaches ex-
ist, including K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.
Several fundamental mathematical definitions for computing
similarity and dissimilarity between pairs of objects using dis-
tance measures, as discussed by [126], are presented below.

Consider a two-dimensional dataset distributed along a spe-
cific direction, represented by axes x1 and x2. To represent
the data more efficiently, we rotate the coordinate system
along the line of distribution, allowing us to represent the data
points using a single axis x′
1 by projecting these points onto
it. Several mathematical tools from linear algebra facilitate
this process, with PCA being the most popular technique
and a prominent example of an unsupervised learning algo-
rithm [123].

analysis (PCA) [123].
C. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
Reinforcement learning is a subset of machine learning that
includes three main components: an agent, an environment,
and actions. The goal of reinforcement learning is to train
an intelligent agent that is capable of navigating its environ-
ment and performing actions that maximize positive rewards,
thereby enhancing performance. Fig 14 illustrates the rein-
forcement learning framework for problem-solving.

![FIGURE 14. Reinforcement learning process.](/mnt/data/1343718_assets/Figure14_p18.png)


FIGURE 14. Reinforcement learning process.
As shown in Figure 14, the reinforcement learning process
operates as a continuous feedback loop. The agent interacts
with the world (environment) by taking actions. In response,
the world provides observations and rewards to the agent
based on the type of action executed. The agent then uses this
feedback to improve its decision-making process by learning
to perform actions associated with positive outcomes [127].
In recent years, many researchers have shown considerable
interest in reinforcement learning within the field of electron-
ics and telecommunications. This algorithm has been applied
to antenna design to improve performance metrics, including
automated design, beamforming, reconfigurable antennas,
and antenna optimization [128].

microwave devices, such as re-
flector antennas [129], and covering surfaces for antenna
radomes [130]. In scenarios where resonant behavior is re-
quired, FSSs are commonly realized as periodic arrays of
metallic patches or apertures embedded in a metal sheet.
Aperture-type FSSs exhibit bandpass properties, being trans-
parent to incident waves within the operational band. Fig 15
illustrates the functionality of a frequency-selective surface
realized as a complementary self-resonant grid [13].
FIGURE 15. Functionality of a frequency-selective metasurface realized
as a complimentary self-resonant grid [13].
Recently, FSS geometries have been utilized in numerous
applications, including radar, satellite, wireless communica-
tion, and chipless RFID at microwave and millimeter-wave
frequencies [132], [133]. However, FSS design encounters
several challenges, including design complexity, frequency
sensitivity, narrow bandwidth, limited adaptability and tun-
ability, angle-of-incidence sensitivity, multifunctionality con-
straints, manufacturing precision requirements, scalability
issues, and real-time performance optimization difficulties.
Machine learning can be applied to FSS design to address
these challenges.
In [134], Fontoura et al. proposed two types of FSS geome-
tries, FSS1 and FSS2, whose structures consist of metallic
patch arrays on dielectric substrates for stopband spatial fil-
tering in microwave applications. A parametric analysis was
performed to evaluate differen

other advanced ML methods such as NN or SVM. Second,
the simulation software used lacks robust verification of real-
world performance under varying conditions, including fab-
rication tolerances, temperature variations, and different sub-
strate materials. For future work, alternative machine learning
models such as deep learning are recommended for improved
prediction accuracy, and the study should be extended to
tunable FSS designs for adaptive applications.

and low-noise training samples guided by this theory. They
employed a genetic algorithm (GA) to compress the raw

In [131], the study addresses the optimization of absorp-
tion properties of patterned graphene metasurface absorbers
(PGMAs) to achieve lightweight, thin structures with tunable
terahertz absorption properties. Designing these absorbers
using traditional methods requires extensive numerical sim-
ulations and is highly time-consuming, as absorption spectra
must be analyzed across various structural parameters. To
address this issue, the authors proposed a machine learning
algorithm based on random forest (RF) to predict absorption
bandwidth and the corresponding structural parameters. The
performance of RF was compared with other classical ML
algorithms. This study has several limitations. First, it focuses
solely on numerical simulation and ML, neglecting the phys-
ical fabrication and measurement of the designed absorbers.
Second, although RF provided the best accuracy, the study

ding techniques such as multistage collaborative
machine learning (MS-CoML), single-output Gaussian pro-
cess regression (SOGPR), multi-output Gaussian process re-
gression (MOGPR), support vector machines (SVM), sup-
port vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural networks
(ANN). In [171], the authors employed a surrogate model for
antenna design and optimization by combining three machine
learning algorithms—MS-CoML, SOGPR, and MOGPR—to
model and optimize multi-objective antenna problems. Fig 20
illustrates the steps to design and optimize an antenna using
ML/DL techniques.
The first step is to define the design objectives, which
involves specifying the target metasurface antenna parame-
ters (e.g., frequency, gain, bandwidth) and establishing con-
straints (e.g., size, material properties). The next step is
to generate a dataset by creating metasurface antenna de-
signs with varying parameter values and simulating their
performance using electromagnetic (EM) simulation software
such as CST Microwave Studio, Advanced Design System
(ADS), or High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS).The
collected data are then preprocessed through normalization
and cleaning procedures. Subsequently, an appropriate ma-
chine learning model is selected, and the data are split into
training and testing sets to train the model for predicting meta-
surface antenna performance. The model’s accuracy is then

tions. Designing metasurface MIMO arrays requires adjust-
ing dozens or hundreds of parameters, including element
geometry, spacing, and phase shift. Classical optimization al-
gorithms typically become trapped in local minima or require
extensive simulation time. Consequently, numerous studies
have employed AI to address these challenges, enabling fast
and efficient optimization, data-driven modeling, real-time
adaptation, and intelligent reconfigurable systems.

Several studies have explored different machine learn-
ing and deep learning algorithms to design and optimize
metasurface-based MIMO antenna parameters. In [189],
the authors proposed a novel antenna structure consisting
of a metasurface-loaded circularly polarized ceramic-based
MIMO antenna to optimize the reflection coefficient and axial
ratio. Three machine learning algorithms were employed: ar-
tificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
and XGBoost. This antenna covers 5G sub-6 GHz appli-
cations with good isolation between ports across the entire
frequency band and efficient axial ratio performance with the
metasurface. To evaluate the performance metrics of the three
ML models, mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error
(MAE), and R2 score were utilized. The R2 scores obtained
for the axia

mushroom-type metasurface [13].
In [131], the study addresses the optimization of absorp-
tion properties of patterned graphene metasurface absorbers
(PGMAs) to achieve lightweight, thin structures with tunable
terahertz absorption properties. Designing these absorbers
using traditional methods requires extensive numerical sim-
ulations and is highly time-consuming, as absorption spectra
must be analyzed across various structural parameters. To
address this issue, the authors proposed a machine learning
algorithm based on random forest (RF) to predict absorption
bandwidth and the corresponding structural parameters. The
performance of RF was compared with other classical ML
algorithms. This study has several limitations. First, it focuses
solely on numerical simulation and ML, neglecting the phys-
ical fabrication and measurement of the designed absorbers.
Second, although RF provided the best accuracy, the study
does not explore more advanced models such as deep learn-
ing (ANNs, CNNs) or Bayesian optimization, which could
further improve design efficiency. For future work, investi-
gating the application of other ML models and conducting
experimental validation to verify ML-predicted designs is
recommended.
Metasurface absorbers can be found in various applica-
tions such as electromagnetic shielding, wireless sensing,
biomedical applications, communication systems, and energy
harvesting. However, the design and analysis of metasurface
absorbers are typically carried out using numerical simu-
lations, which are highly time-consuming. To mitigate the
computational burden associated with design and analysis,
Sumbel Ijaz et al. [144] explored the application of machine
learning to design metasurface-based broadband absorbers.
They employed four machine learning algorithms: XGBoost,
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO),
and Random Forest (RF), all of which were applied in both
forward and inverse design. The inverse design was imple-
mented using PCA. Fig 19 shows a schematic of the presented
work. This study acknowledges certain limitations, includ-
ing hyperparameter optimization challenges. The optimiza-
tion of these hyperparameters can be complex and computa-
tionally intensive, especially in multi-constrained scenarios.
Additionally, ML models are typically trained on specific
datasets, which may limit their ability to generalize. For
future work, advanced ML algorithms using sophisticated
techniques such as deep learning and reinforcement learning
are recommended. Furthermore, research should focus on
designing multifunctional metasurfaces capable of simulta-
neous energy harvesting and electromagnetic shielding.
In [145], the authors proposed a novel approach for the
design and high-performance prediction of metasurface ab-
sorbers called customized adaptive cascaded deep learning
(ACDL). The model employs a series of sub-deep neural
network layers with forward noise mitigation. The study
demonstrates that ACDL can rapidly and accurately retrieve
design parameters for metasurface absorbers, achieving a
prediction accuracy of 94% with a dataset of 7,000 samples.
This approach enhances the robustness of the design pro-
cess and improves sparse dataset handling, making it less
time-consuming and computationally efficient. This study

though the study offers significant predictive power, several
limitations are evident. First, the study focuses on a specific
metasurface absorber design, which may not be generalizable
to all metasurface configurations. Second, while DL models
can be very powerful, they are only as effective as the data
on which they are trained. Third, the complex relationship
between metasurface design and electromagnetic responses
can hinder the convergence of the neural network. For future
work, improving convergence speed and stability using ad-
vanced optimization techniques is recommended. Addition-
ally, developing more efficient methods for generating train-
ing data, such as surrogate models or graph neural networks
(GNNs) to handle complex, non-Euclidean design spaces,
would be beneficial. Various studies have employed different
ML/DL algorithms to design and optimize absorber metasur-
faces, as summarized in Table III. The comparison is con-
ducted based on several parameters including optimization
method, ML/DL algorithm used, electromagnetic simulation
software, input/output parameters, and a brief description of
the main objectives of each study.
C. METASURFACE POLARIZATION USING ML/DL.
Electromagnetic wave polarization describes the orientation
of the electric field (E-field) oscillation as the wave prop-
agates through space. When a wave propagates through a
waveguide, it typically exists in what is referred to as a
transverse electromagnetic mode, which represents a particu-
lar field configuration. These modes can be categorized into
transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes.
According to IEEE standard definitions for antennas [161],
[162], the polarization of a radiated wave is defined as ‘‘that
property of an electromagnetic wave describing the time-
varying direction and relative magnitude of the electric-field
vector; specifically, the figure traced as a function of time by
the extremity of the vector at a fixed location in space, and
the sense in which it is traced, as observed along the direction
of propagation.’’ The property of electromagnetic wave polar-
ization offers an additional information channel in radio and
optical systems for various purposes, including 5G/6G net-
works, IoT sensors, wireless communication systems, polari-
metric optical coherence tomography (pOCT), polarimetric
ultrasound, and wearable ECG (electrocardiogram) and EEG
(electroencephalogram) devices. An important functionality
of polarizers is the conversion from linear polarization (LP)
to circular polarization (CP) during transmission through a
metasurface (MS) [163].
In [164], the authors proposed employing a deep convo-
lutional generative adversarial network (DC-GAN) to gen-
erate designs of anisotropic RF metamaterial unit cells for
metasurface arrays. This approach learns the complex rela-
tionships between meta-atom structures and their reflection
spectra for both vertical and horizontal polarizations. While
the DC-GAN achieved 90% accuracy, the study has several
limitations. Specifically, reflection response errors reached
0.2 dB in magnitude and 4 degrees in phase. Furthermore,
the paper did not include fabrication or experimental valida-
tion of the generated designs. For future work, the authors
plan to employ more sophisticated machine learning models
such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Additionally, exploring more advanced GAN
architectures to improve accuracy is recommended, along
with incorporating fabrication and experimental validation
to investigate the application of this method for designing
metasurfaces at terahertz frequencies.
In [165], the study presents machine learning and deep
learning algorithms for designing anisotropic digital cod-
ing metasurfaces and predicting the fast and complex phase
responses of meta-atoms under different polarizations. The
network was trained on 70,000 coding patterns and validated
with 10,000 patterns. This approach achieved 90.5% accuracy
with a 2◦phase error. The study demonstrated three functional
1-bit anisotropic coding metasurfaces for dual and triple-
beam scattering with different polarization properties. The
main limitations of this study include reliance on a dataset
of 70,000 training and 10,000 validation samples, which may
limit the generalization of the neural network to entirely new
or unseen coding patterns. Additionally, the focus is limited to
1-bit anisotropic coding metasurfaces rather than extending to
higher-bit or more complex designs. Future work will include
extending the approach to high-bit metasurfaces, enhancing
neural network accuracy, and integration with optimization
algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA).
Nowadays, various design methods for polarization meta-

## Equations and Mathematical Models

### Equation (1) (Page 10)


Metasurfaces have the potential to revolutionize various elec-
tronic device technologies. They can simultaneously and in-
dependently control multiple properties of electromagnetic
waves, including amplitude A, polarization p, frequency f ,
and phase ϕ. These four intrinsic properties characterize a
classical electromagnetic wave, as presented in the electric
field expression in Equation (1) [88].

referred to as inference. The model equation contains param-

the model equation describes a family of possible relation-

specify the particular relationship within that family. To make

returns output y [106].

FIGURE 18. Functionality of a frequency-selective absorber based on a
mushroom-type metasurface [13].
In [131], the study addresses the optimization of absorp-
tion properties of patterned graphene metasurface absorbers
(PGMAs) to achieve lightweight, thin structures with tunable
terahertz absorption properties. Designing these absorbers
using traditional methods requires extensive numerical sim-
ulations and is highly time-consuming, as absorption spectra
must be analyzed across various structural parameters. To
address this issue, the authors proposed a machine learning
algorithm based on random forest (RF) to predict absorption
bandwidth and the corresponding structural parameters. The
performance of RF was compared with other classical ML
algorithms. This study has several limitations. First, it focuses
solely on numerical simulation and ML, neglecting the phys-
ical fabrication and measurement of the designed absorbers.
Second, although RF provided the best accuracy, the study
does not explore more advanced models such as deep learn-
ing (ANNs, CNNs) or Bayesian optimization, which could
further improve design efficiency. For future work, investi-
gating the application of other ML models and conducting
experimental validation to verify ML-predicted designs is
recommended.
Metasurface absorbers can be found in various applica-
tions such as electromagnetic shielding, wireless sensing,
biomedical applications, communication systems, and energy
harvesting. However, the design and analysis of metasurface
absorbers are typically carried out using numerical simu-
lations, which are highly time-consuming. To mitigate the
computational burden associated with design and analysis,
Sumbel Ijaz et al. [144] explored the application of machine
learning to design metasurface-based broadband absorbers.
They employed four machine learning algorithms: XGBoost,
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO),
and Random Forest (RF), all of which were applied in both
forward and inverse design. The inverse design was imple-
mented using PCA. Fig 19 shows a schematic of the presented
work. This study acknowledges certain limitations, includ-
ing hyperparameter optimization challenges. The optimiza-
tion of these hyperparameters can be complex and computa-
tionally intensive, especially in multi-constrained scenarios.
Additionally, ML models are typically trained on specific
datasets, which may limit their ability to generalize. For
future work, advanced ML algorithms using sophisticated
techniques such as deep learning and reinforcement learning
are recommended. Furthermore, research should focus on
designing multifunctional metasurfaces capable of simulta-
neous energy harvesting and electromagnetic shielding.
In [145], the authors proposed a novel approach for the
design and high-performance prediction of metasurface ab-
sorbers called customized adaptive cascaded deep learning
(ACDL). The model employs a series of sub-deep neural
network layers with forward noise mitigation. The study
demonstrates that ACDL can rapidly and accurately retrieve
design parameters for metasurface absorbers, achieving a
prediction accuracy of 94% with a dataset of 7,000 samples.
This approach enhances the robustness of the design pro-
cess and improves sparse dataset handling, making it less
time-consuming and computationally efficient. This study

and 5.49%). The model provides high predictive accuracy. Al-
though the study offers significant predictive power, several
limitations are evident. First, the study focuses on a specific
metasurface absorber design, which may not be generalizable
to all metasurface configurations. Second, while DL models
can be very powerful, they are only as effective as the data
on which they are trained. Third, the complex relationship
between metasurface design and electromagnetic responses
can hinder the convergence of the neural network. For future
work, improving convergence speed and stability using ad-
vanced optimization techniques is recommended. Addition-
ally, developing more efficient methods for generating train-
ing data, such as surrogate models or graph neural networks
(GNNs) to handle complex, non-Euclidean design spaces,
would be beneficial. Various studies have employed different
ML/DL algorithms to design and optimize absorber metasur-
faces, as summarized in Table III. The comparison is con-
ducted based on several parameters including optimization
method, ML/DL algorithm used, electromagnetic simulation
software, input/output parameters, and a brief description of
the main objectives of each study.
C. METASURFACE POLARIZATION USING ML/DL.
Electromagnetic wave polarization describes the orientation
of the electric field (E-field) oscillation as the wave prop-
agates through space. When a wave propagates through a
waveguide, it typically exists in what is referred to as a
transverse electromagnetic mode, which represents a particu-
lar field configuration. These modes can be categorized into
transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes.
According to IEEE standard definitions for antennas [161],
[162], the polarization of a radiated wave is defined as ‘‘that
property of an electromagnetic wave describing the time-
varying direction and relative magnitude of the electric-field
vector; specifically, the figure traced as a function of time by
the extremity of the vector at a fixed location in space, and
the sense in which it is traced, as observed along the direction
of propagation.’’ The property of electromagnetic wave polar-
ization offers an additional information channel in radio and
optical systems for various purposes, including 5G/6G net-
works, IoT sensors, wireless communication systems, polari-
metric optical coherence tomography (pOCT), polarimetric
ultrasound, and wearable ECG (electrocardiogram) and EEG
(electroencephalogram) devices. An important functionality
of polarizers is the conversion from linear polarization (LP)
to circular polarization (CP) during transmission through a
metasurface (MS) [163].
In [164], the authors proposed employing a deep convo-
lutional generative adversarial network (DC-GAN) to gen-
erate designs of anisotropic RF metamaterial unit cells for
metasurface arrays. This approach learns the complex rela-
tionships between meta-atom structures and their reflection
spectra for both vertical and horizontal polarizations. While
the DC-GAN achieved 90% accuracy, the study has several
limitations. Specifically, reflection response errors reached
0.2 dB in magnitude and 4 degrees in phase. Furthermore,
the paper did not include fabrication or experimental valida-
tion of the generated designs. For future work, the authors
plan to employ more sophisticated machine learning models
such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Additionally, exploring more advanced GAN
architectures to improve accuracy is recommended, along
with incorporating fabrication and experimental validation
to investigate the application of this method for designing
metasurfaces at terahertz frequencies.
In [165], the study presents machine learning and deep
learning algorithms for designing anisotropic digital cod-
ing metasurfaces and predicting the fast and complex phase
responses of meta-atoms under different polarizations. The
network was trained on 70,000 coding patterns and validated
with 10,000 patterns. This approach achieved 90.5% accuracy
with a 2◦phase error. The study demonstrated three functional
1-bit anisotropic coding metasurfaces for dual and triple-
beam scattering with different polarization properties. The
main limitations of this study include reliance on a dataset
of 70,000 training and 10,000 validation samples, which may
limit the generalization of the neural network to entirely new
or unseen coding patterns. Additionally, the focus is limited to
1-bit anisotropic coding metasurfaces rather than extending to
higher-bit or more complex designs. Future work will include
extending the approach to high-bit metasurfaces, enhancing
neural network accuracy, and integration with optimization
algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA).

generate datasets, followed by applying ML models such
as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Random Forest (RF), or Deep

## Design Techniques, Configurations, and Methodologies

### Forward design (extracted)


Forward design: The forward design approach focuses
directly on the geometry of the metasurface to accomplish
desired performance metrics, such as beamforming or band-
width optimization. Machine learning and deep learning
models are utilized to predict and optimize the metasurface
design by simulating electromagnetic behavior.


### Inverse design (extracted)


Inverse design: The inverse design approach focuses on
employing AI algorithms to discover the optimal metasurface
structure based on desired performance outcomes, such as
specific radiation patterns or polarization control. Both ap-
proaches offer more efficient and precise metasurface antenna
design, reducing the need for trial-and-error procedures and
accelerating the development process.
Inverse design is typically formulated to search for the op-
timal input conditions within a predefined domain using an
optimization algorithm. Almost all inverse design problems
are inherently challenging and require advanced algorithms,
including heuristic methods such as the ant colony algo-
rithm [22], genetic algorithm [168], particle swarm opti-
mization [24], and topological optimization [25]–[27]. Nu-
merous researchers are currently interested in the field of
reconfigurable reflective metasurface antennas using deep
learning [49]. These metasurfaces have the unique capability
of dynamic adjustment, enabling electronic control over the
antenna’s radiation pattern and beam direction. The reconfig-
urable metasurface is a technology that facilitates fast and
precise changes in the antenna’s beam steering, making it
suitable for diverse applications such as wireless communi-
cation, beamforming, and radar in an efficient manner [30]–
[34], [48]. In the aspect of Neural Networks (NNs), some
studies employ an autoencoder NN that combines cascade
encoder and decoder architectures. Machine learning tech-
niques have been employed in communication technology,
such as intelligent antennas [35], antenna selection in wireless
communications [36], [37], and antenna design and optimiza-
tion [38], [39]. Automatic calibration involves ML algorithms
that can automate the calibration process of antenna systems,
including adjusting parameters such as phase, amplitude, and
polarization to ensure optimal performance based on envi-
ronmental conditions and system requirements [40], [41].
Metasurfaces are very thin layers of material consisting of
manufactured surfaces with periodic or quasi-periodic sub-
wavelength features designed to manipulate electromagnetic
waves in a precise manner. The standard unit cell size (usually
λ/10 to λ/5), thickness (varying from nanometers to microme-
ters), and material properties, such as conductivity and dielec-
tric constant, are critical design parameters. Electromagnetic
(EM) indicators including resonance frequency, bandwidth,
reflection/transmission coefficients, and polarization control
play crucial roles in defining performance metrics. Functional
capabilities, such as beam steering, frequency selectivity,
and tunability, are accomplished through the integration of
sophisticated materials, such as graphene or phase-change
materials for precise manipulation of electromagnetic prop-
erties. Therefore, metasurfaces are characterized by produc-
tion methods, thermal stability, and efficiency, making these
factors suitable for different applications in communications,

surface antennas are driven by six specification requirements,

guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all relevant research papers. The three-year period was considered to span from 2022 to 2025. Papers written in languages other than English were excluded from con-sideration. The primary keywords for searching papers were "metasurface absorber," "metasurface antenna," "metasurface polarization," "electromagnetic metasurface," "metasurface antenna for microwave," "metasurface for direction of ar-rival," "transmission/reflection metasurface antenna," "fre-quency selective surface," "inverse design for metasurface," "smart antenna," "antenna array," "antenna design," and "an-tenna optimization" using artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as well as optimization algorithms. Two Boolean operators were used to identify the keywords: "OR" and "AND." The papers were selected based on several factors, including the title, keywords, abstract, and conclusion. From multiple reputable sources, notably Nature Advanced Materials, IEEE, Elsevier, arXiv, Wiley, IET, MDPI, PIER, AEM, and numerous online databases, a total of 360 publications were identified. Of these 360 articles, 105 articles were manually eliminated due to their irrelevance to the primary research topic. In other words, they did not satisfy the conditions for implementing ML and DL in metasurface antenna engineering. A comprehensive assessment of the remaining 255 publications was conducted, resulting in the selection of 200 studies for inclusion, which are utilized as references in this paper. Of the 200 studies, 140 examine ML and DL applications for antennas and metasurface antennas, presenting various methodologies, datasets, and performance outcomes. The remaining 60 documents consist of research articles, review papers, and web portals that include AI reviews, metasurface studies, metamaterial research, and antenna investigations, which are utilized for in-
troductory descriptions. Fig 2 illustrates the PRISMA guide-lines followed in this survey study. The principal contribu-tions of this survey are delineated as follows:
1) Classification of electromagnetic metasurfaces and metasurface-based antennas by design structure and antenna type.
2) Discussion of electromagnetic metasurfaces, including uniform and non-uniform configurations.

### Approaches to improving metasurface antenna performance (extracted)


D. APPROACHES TO IMPROVING METASURFACE ANTENNA PERFORMANCE
To enhance metasurface antenna performance, various tech-niques are employed to improve gain, bandwidth, size re-duction, specific absorption rate (SAR), radar cross section 10 VOLUME 11, 2023

(RCS), polarization conversion efficiency, and reconfigura-bility [92]. Fig 5 illustrates the key metasurface antenna enhancement techniques that can be employed for 5G, IoT, satellite communications, radar systems, and medical appli-cations [93].
FIGURE 5. Various performance enhancement techniques for metasurface antenna.
Structure optimization technique: This represents the
most effective approach for enhancing the performance of
metasurface antennas by modifying their physical architec-
ture to control electromagnetic waves. Various techniques
exist to manipulate EM waves, including unit cell geometry
tuning (utilizing square, cross, and ring resonator configu-
rations) to optimize reflection and transmission properties,
defected ground structure (DGS) implementation through
Complementary Split Ring Resonators (CSRRs) to improve
bandwidth, multi-layer metasurface design employing multi-
layer stacking to enhance impedance matching and radiation
efficiency, and metamaterial superstrate placement to aug-
ment gain and beam steering capabilities [57], [70], [71].
Material optimization technique: The selection and engi-
neering of materials represents a critical approach for enhanc-
ing metasurface antenna performance to improve efficiency
and adaptability. Dielectric constant selection involves choos-
ing low-loss, high dielectric constant substrates such as FR4
and Rogers RT5880, as the substrate dielectric constant sig-
nificantly affects antenna performance in terms of bandwidth
and gain [94].
Hybrid technique ML + EM simulation: This approach
combines machine learning with electromagnetic simulation
tools such as CST, ADS, and ANSYS, offering a powerful
methodology for designing and optimizing metasurface an-
tennas. The process involves using EM simulation tools to
generate datasets, followed by applying ML models such
as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Random Forest (RF), or Deep
Learning (DL) to predict sweep parameters like S11, optimize
dimensions, and perform inverse design to predict required
antenna patterns based on desired frequency responses. Con-
sequently, several studies have employed ML techniques
integrated with CST modeling tools to develop high-gain,
low-return loss antennas with improved performance for 5G
applications [95].
Bandwidth and gain enhancement: This technique plays
an essential role in antenna design. Various performance
enhancement methods exist for metasurface antenna design,
including metasurface-reflectarray antennas to improve beam
shaping and gain enhancement, multi-resonant metasurfaces
to broaden bandwidth, and high-impedance surfaces (HIS) to
reduce surface wave losses through HIS-based metasurfaces,
thereby enhancing overall efficiency and boosting antenna
gain [96].
Reconfigurability and active metasurface: This repre-
sents a significant advancement in antenna technology, en-
abling dynamic control over antenna performance. Meth-
ods include integrating micro-electro-mechanical-system
(MEMS)-based metasurfaces to tune the structure dynami-
cally, utilizing liquid crystal and tunable material substrates to
modify antenna performance in real time, and incorporating
active elements such as PIN diodes and varactors to achieve
beam steering, frequency reconfiguration, and polarization
control [97].
