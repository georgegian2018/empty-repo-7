## SECTION 4: EQUATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS

### 4.1 Friis Transmission Equation (Free-Space Path Loss)

**Standard Friis Formula:**
$$P_r = P_t G_t G_r \left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d}\right)^2$$

Where:
- $P_r$ = Received power (watts)
- $P_t$ = Transmitted power (watts)
- $G_t$ = Transmit antenna gain (linear)
- $G_r$ = Receive antenna gain (linear)
- $\lambda$ = Wavelength of transmitted signal (meters)
- $d$ = Distance between transmitter and receiver (meters)

**Application:** Fundamental equation for calculating THz propagation path loss

### 4.2 Free-Space Path Loss in Decibels

**Logarithmic Form:**
$$PL = 10 \lg \frac{P_t}{P_r} = 20 \lg \left(\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda}\right) - 10 \lg(G_t G_r)$$

**Frequency-Dependent Form:**
$$PL(f) = 20 \lg f + 20 \lg d + 20 \lg \left(\frac{4\pi}{c}\right) - 10 \lg(G_t G_r)$$

**Key Characteristic:** Path loss increases 20 dB per decade of frequency increase
- Example: Loss increases by 20 dB from 30 GHz to 300 GHz (when distance and gains are constant)

### 4.3 Receive Antenna Effective Aperture

**Relationship Between Gain and Aperture:**
$$A_r = G_r \left(\frac{\lambda^2}{4\pi}\right)$$

Where:
- $A_r$ = Effective aperture area (square meters)
- $G_r$ = Receive antenna gain (linear)
- $\lambda$ = Wavelength (meters)

**Key Insight:** For fixed antenna gain, effective aperture decreases with frequency squared, contributing to high THz path loss

### 4.4 Atmospheric Absorption Loss

**General Expression:**
$$\alpha(f,h) = \int_0^h \alpha_0(f, \text{altitude}) \, dz$$

Where:
- $\alpha(f,h)$ = Absorption coefficient at frequency $f$ over height $h$
- $\alpha_0(f, \text{altitude})$ = Specific absorption coefficient as function of frequency and altitude
- $h$ = Propagation distance through atmosphere

**Notable Characteristics:**
- Strong absorption peaks at specific molecular resonances (water vapor, oxygen)
- Absorption can exceed 1000 dB/km in worst-case scenarios
- Highly frequency-dependent with major peaks at 60 GHz, 118 GHz, 183 GHz, etc.

### 4.5 Molecular Absorption Lines (Key Frequencies)

**Water Vapor Absorption Line:**
$$f_{H_2O} \approx 183.31 \text{ GHz}$$

**Oxygen Absorption Line:**
$$f_{O_2} \approx 118.75 \text{ GHz}$$

**Secondary Oxygen Line:**
$$f_{O_2, 2nd} \approx 60 \text{ GHz}$$

**Significance:** These frequencies experience extreme atmospheric absorption, creating "opaque windows" for THz communications

- Pt = Transmitted power (watts)
- Gt = Transmit antenna gain (linear scale)
- Gr = Receive antenna gain (linear scale)
- λ = Wavelength (meters)
- d = Distance (meters)

**Logarithmic Form (dB):**
PL = 20 log(4πd/λ) – 10 log(Gt·Gr)

**Key Property:** Path loss increases 20 dB per frequency decade
- Example: 100× frequency increase = 20 dB loss increase (if all else constant)

**Caption:** Fig. 1. Six usage scenarios for IMT-2030 and four overarching aspects, specified by the ITU-R in June 2023 [2]. In what follows, this paper focuses on the usage scenario of Integrated Sensing and Communication. Driven by the continuous progress in frequency assignment, antennas, devices, and signal processing, 6G will be a dual-functional system that is able to not only communicate but also sense as well [18]. This usage scenario enables 6G and beyond to see the physical world through electromagnetic (EM) waves [19]. It offers high-resolution sensing, localization, imaging, and environment reconstruction capabilities to improve communications performance. Also, it supports a wide range of novel applications beyond communications such as object tracking, security screening, remote sensing, process monitoring, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), gesture recognition, and activity detection [20], distinguishing 6G from the traditional communication-oriented cellular systems from the first generation (1G) to 5G. A. Why do 6G and beyond need the THz band? The THz band has attracted a lot of interest in recent years and is recognized as a promising enabler for 6G [21]. Prior to stepping into technical details, we would like to first clarify a fundamental question that might cause some confusion or disputes in some prior literature. That is, why do we need to exploit the THz band in 6G and beyond? We try to address this aspect from the perspectives of both THz communications and THz sensing, as well as their synergy. 1) THz Communications: At the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) held in 2019, a.k.a WRC-19, the ITU-R assigned a total of 13.5 GHz spectrum, consisting of a group of high-frequency bands, for the deployment of 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) communications [1], as we will elaborate in Sec. II-B. Despite the spectral abundance of mmWave bands, it might not be sufficient to meet the growing need for bandwidth over the next decade. There are enormous spectral resources at higher frequencies that were already used for a wide variety of non-cellular applications, such as remote sensing, radio astronomy, and radar [22], to name a few. With the advancement in antenna technology and radio frequency (RF) components, these frequencies previously considered unsuitable for mobile communications due to their unfavorable propagation characteristics become technologically usable [23]. Fig. 2 illustrates the whole EM spectrum, consisting of radio, microwave, infrared (IR), visible light, ultraviolet, Xrays, and Gamma rays, from the lower to higher frequencies [24]. It is noted that the definition of the EM spectrum in the general case differs from the naming of frequency bands from the perspective of wireless communications, as shown in the figure. Based on these considerations, it is argued that the THz band is a suitable candidate to realize Tbps communications under the current level of hardware and signal-processing technologies. The reasons are explained as follows: • Spectrum scarcity of the sub-6 GHz band: The favourable propagation characteristics of sub-6 GHz frequencies facilitate the use of sophisticated transmission technologies such as massive multi-input multioutput (MMIMO) [25], non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) [26], and high-order modulation like 1024-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (1024QAM) to achieve high spectral efficiency. However, spectrum scarcity and non-continuity pose a significant challenge to achieving higher rates. Even if the sub-6 GHz band ultimately determines a bandwidth of 1 GHz for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) services, a Tbps link can only be realized under the extreme spectral efficiency of 1000 bps/Hz, as suggested by the Shannon capacity R = B log(1 + S/N). However, such high performance is impractical in the foreseeable future. In comparison, as specified in ITU-R M.2410 [27], the peak spectral efficiency for IMT-2020 is 30 bps/Hz (in ideal conditions). • Insufficient mmWave bandwidth below 100 GHz: At WRC-19, the mmWave spectrum in 24.25-27.5 GHz, 37-43.5 GHz, 45.5-47 GHz, 47.2-48.2 GHz and 66–71 GHz, was assigned to IMT services [28]. There is a challenge from the perspective of RF implementation, which is typically constrained by the limit of around 10% relative bandwidth. That is to say, mmWave technologies below 100 GHz can support a single RF transceiver with

### Fig. 2
**Caption:** Fig. 2. The electromagnetic spectrum and the positions of mmWave, THz, and optical bands. Unlike ionizing radiation, THz frequencies are non-ionizing because their photon energy is not sufficient (0.1 to 12.4meV, which is over three orders of magnitude weaker than ionizing photon energy levels) to release an electron from an atom or a molecule, where typically 12eV is required for ionization. The THz band offers abundant spectral resources, ranging from tens of gigahertz to several terahertz, depending on the transmission distance. This makes the available bandwidth more than ten times greater than that of mmWave bands, while the operating frequency is at least one order of magnitude below the optical bands. In addition, the technologies required to make Tbps-level transmission over the THz band a reality is rapidly advancing [37]. For example, novel antennas and components are under development by exploiting cutting-edge materials like graphene, to overcome the THz gap, where the operating frequency is too high for conventional electronic transmitters and too low for photonic emitters [33], as we will elaborate in Sec. VI. Moreover, ultra-massive multiinput multi-output (UMMIMO) and lens antenna arrays to generate high-gain beams, with the aid of appropriate beam alignment techniques, compensating for the large free-space loss, atmospheric absorption, and weather effects, are other promising technologies, as introduced in Sec. IV and Sec. VII. 2) THz Sensing: The spatial resolution of a propagated signal becomes much finer at higher frequencies, thereby enabling high-definition spatial differentiation [35]. In addition to THz communications, THz sensing (including positioning, imaging, and spectroscopy) exploits the tiny wavelength on the order of micrometers and the frequency-selective resonances of various materials over the measured environment to gain unique information based on the observed signal signature [38]. Compared with wireless sensing over other bands, THz sensing offers the following advantages: • High resolution and penetration capabilities: Although low-frequency signals are able to sense, detect, and localize objects, as the radar [22] and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), THz sensing/positioning can improve the resolution due to the small wavelength, even for objects hidden from direct view. THz waves are able to penetrate a variety of non-conductive materials, e.g., plastics, fabrics, paper, ceramics, and dielectric substances. This allows THz sensing to detect hidden objects, structural defects, and layers beneath surfaces, making it useful in security screening, quality control, process monitoring, and material characterization [39]. • Non-ionizing radiation: Compared to X-rays and Gamma rays, THz waves have much lower photon energy, making them non-ionizing [40]. This implies that THz sensing is generally considered safe for biological samples and humans, allowing for non-destructive and non-invasive imaging and diagnosing. • Low environmental interference: In contrast to visible or IR radiation [41], THz waves are less vulnerable to environmental factors such as ambient light, fog, or smoke. It allows THz sensing for outdoor environments or adverse conditions, expanding its usability in fields such as remote sensing, atmospheric monitoring, and outdoor stand-off security screening of dangerous items like firearms, bombs, and explosive belts hidden beneath clothing [35]. • Spectroscopic analysis: THz waves interact with molecules in a characteristic manner, leading to unique spectral fingerprints. THz spectroscopy provides valuable

**Caption:** Fig. 5. Rain attenuation measured in dB/km for terrestrial communications links as a function of the rain rate and frequency, covering the range from 1 GHz to 1000 GHz. The rain rate is measured in millimeters per hour (mm/h), averaging over a period of time such as one hour. The values from light rain (1 mm/h) to heavy rain (200 mm/h) are illustrated. The peak of attenuation occurs on the frequency band from 100 GHz to 300 GHz since the wavelength in this band matches the size of raindrops. uniform fog or cloud environment. In addition to mmWave signals [168], many recent efforts of investigating THz waves in the presence of rains and fogs have been conducted, as listed in Table VI. Besides, the propagation loss during snowfall has been studied through measurement campaigns. F. Norouzian et al. assessed the attenuation through various intensities of snowfall experimentally at 300 GHz in their work [148], as well as subTHz frequencies (100 GHz to 300 GHz) in [149]. Unlike other weather conditions, there is no theoretical basis for snow because of the challenging nature of defining snowflake shape and size distributions. An equivalent ITU-R model to calculate the snow attenuation does not exist and the snow particles are merely considered as raindrops. As a rule of thumb, measurement results indicate that snow attenuation at 300 GHz is less than 20 dB/km for snowfall rates below 20 mm/h [149]. Last but not least, much work has been done to investigate one of the most common types of contaminant in outdoor environments, i.e., dust or sand. The authors of [147] quantified the attenuation at 150 GHz and 300 GHz in the presence of sand for outdoor THz sensing. D. Blockage Loss Due to the small wavelength of THz waves, the dimensions of surrounding physical objects are sufficiently large for scattering, while specular reflections on ordinary surfaces become difficult. On the other hand, THz systems rely heavily on pencil beams to extend the effective propagation distance. As a result, a direct path between the transmitter and receiver is desired. However, the LoS THz link is highly susceptible to being blocked by macro objects, such as buildings, furniture, vehicles, and foliage, and micro-objects, e.g., humans, in comparison with traditional sub-6G signals [154]. A single blockage might cause a signal loss of a few tens of dB. The extent of foliage loss is related to the depth of vegetation [170], where 17 dB, 22 dB, and 25 dB are observed at 28 GHz, 60 GHz, and 90 GHz, respectively. The blockage loss due to vehicles [156] is determined by the vehicle type and geometry, from 20 dB in the front-shield glass to 50 dB in the engine area. The human body blockage imposes a more profound influence because of the dynamic movement of humans and the close interaction of THz devices with humans. The loss attributed to the self-body blockage [155] is expected to reach approximately 40 dB in the THz band. Such blockage losses can dramatically decay the signal power and may even lead to a thorough outage. Hence, it is necessary to clarify the traits of blockage and find effective solutions to avoid being blocked or quickly recover the connection when a link gets blocked. Statistical models can be applied to estimate the impact of blockage loss. For instance, the self-body blockage loss may be approximated as a Boolean model where a human is treated as a three-dimensional cylinder with centers forming a two-dimensional (2D) Poisson point process (PPP). A LoS blockage probability model assumes that a link of distance d will be LoS with probability pL(d) and NLoS otherwise. The expressions of pL(d) are usually obtained empirically for different settings. The blockage probability for a LoS link with a self-body blockage can be estimated by the method given in [172]. In [173], 3GPP specified an urban macro-cell scenario, where a calculation method for a LoS blockage probability is given. The same model applies to the urban micro-cell scenario, with a smaller distance range. There are some variations in the expressions of the LoS probability across different channel measurement campaigns and environments, e.g., the model developed by NYU [154]. Some other prior works also revealed quantitative results to estimate the blockage loss at THz frequencies, as given in Table VI. V. THZ CHANNEL MEASUREMENT AND MODELING FOR 6G AND BEYOND Novel 6G usage scenarios such as kiosk downloading, nano-communications, wireless backhauling, and integrated communications and sensing pose many peculiarities in transmission distances, hardware capabilities, and propagation environments [57]. These unique propagation characteristics and particular requirements motivate the research community to perform further research on wireless channels. Extensive measurement campaigns and channel modeling efforts are expected for the success of deploying 6G and beyond. On the other hand, many challenging issues such as appropriate measurement equipment and novel modeling methodologies are barriers ahead [103]. This section summarizes the state of the art in channel measurement campaigns and presents upto-date channel models of the THz band for 6G and beyond use cases. A.

### Fig. 6
**Caption:** Fig. 6. This entails passing a modulated baseband signal to the front-end circuitry. Then, it is up-converted to the THz carrier frequency by mixing with the local oscillator (LO) signal. The signal is amplified and sent over an antenna. At the receiver, the same steps are applied in a reverse order, and the down-converted signal is passed to the baseband circuitry for further processing. The most critical aspect lies in LO generation, as it involves synthesizing a THz signal. To achieve this, a multiplexer is employed to upconvert a high-frequency signal into the THz range. However, it’s important to note that each multiplexer stage introduces additional inter-modulation products, which in turn raise the noise figure and distort the generated signal. Consequently, the number of multiplexer stages becomes a limiting factor for THz signal generation. Table IX offers a summary of the literature on the transmitter and receiver front end in terms of different semiconductor technologies. Among III-V semiconductor materials, InP components demonstrate superior results in terms of output power and noise figure. Furthermore, InP transistors can reach a maximum oscillating frequency fmax of up to 1.5 THz [293]. A transceiver design based on a high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) was reported. HEMT supports THz frequencies up to 850 GHz, with particular attention given to the frequency band around 300 GHz [280], [294], [295]. SiGe and CMOS are both silicon-based technologies suitable for the THz frequency band. Due to the intrinsic characteristics of silicon, the maximum oscillation frequency is limited below 1 THz. There are studies that show heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) based on 130 nm SiGe process reaching fmax of 620 GHz [296] as well as 720 GHz [297]. The SiGe components fabricated for HBTs exhibit advantages such as good linearity, high gain, and low noise. However, the power gain is limited, which prevents the operation above 500 GHz. Recent research focused particularly on the components and devices for THz communications and sensing over the D-band, which refers to the range of frequencies around 110 GHz to 170 GHz. As a result, novel transceiver design was introduced such as those presented in [284], [285], [298], [299]. The authors of [300] demonstrated a complete communication link that realizes a high throughput of 200 Gbps. Some researchers present their transceiver design operating around 300 GHz [288], [290], [301]–[303]. A detailed survey on SiGe transceiver for different purposes is provided in [304]. THz devices built from CMOS exhibit lower performance compared to other semiconductor technologies. CMOS fieldeffect transistors (FETs) can only reach a maximum oscillating frequency of around 450 GHz, with limited power gain. Nevertheless, CMOS technology is known for its low production costs, which is its major advantage. The transceivers operating at 240 GHz [288], [305], [306] or 300 GHz [307]–[310] were implemented. The authors of [289]–[291] showcased some CMOS transcivers operating in 300 GHz, which achieve high data rates such as 105 Gbps or 32 Gbps. The highest reported operating frequency is 390 GHz, reaching a data throughput of 28 Gbps. Further achievements of CMOS transceiver are summarized in [106], [311], [312]. 2) Photonic Devices: To transition from extremely highfrequency photonic radiation to a lower THz frequency, an optical frequency downconverter, commonly known as photomixing, is required. Illustrated in Fig. 7, this process involves feeding two laser signals with frequencies f1 and f2 towards a photomixing diode, such as the uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (UTC-PD) [314]. Subsequently, the photodiode, akin to traditional high-frequency mixing, generates a THz signal at frequency fTHz = f1 −f2. Photomixing provides high tunability and modulation bandwidth. Also, a variety of complex modulation schemes may be implemented with moderate efforts, as compared to electronic solutions. Fig. 7 shows two modulation approaches, modulation of both laser

A further advantage is the ability to deliver an optical signal over a large distance by means of an optical fiber. Thus, optical signal generation and modulation may be performed separated from the THz signal generation, which may yield flexibility to the transmission system [23]. Another photonic method of generating THz signals is through quantum cascade laser (QCL). Conventional lasers emit photons through the recombination of electron-hole pairs across the band gap. Thus, the lower bound for the frequency of the emitted photons is defined by the band gap, which limits the ability of the lasers to work below the IR band. In contrast, QCLs are unipolar [315]. The photons are emitted by quantum jumps of electrons between two different energy levels. These energy levels are defined by the structure of the quantum wells. This provides the possibility to tune the frequency of the laser. Due to the low energy gap between the energy levels, QCLs are well suited for mid-IR applications. In recent decades, there was also a big progress on QCL development for the farIR or THz range [316]. QCLs are able to cover the frequency band from 1 THz to 5 THz with a peak radiation power of 1 W [317]–[319]. However, the operating frequency for QCL is in the cryogenic range, which limits their applications. VII. BEAM-FORMING AND ALIGNMENT FOR THZ COMMUNICATIONS AND SENSING The use of the THz band can alleviate the problem of spectrum scarcity and facilitate novel applications, such as nano-scale networks and in-device communications. However, its practical use is challenged by large propagation losses, which generally lead to very short distances of signal transmission [320]. The main causes of this problem include the high spreading loss that grows quadratically with carrier frequency, the gaseous absorption due to oxygen molecules and water vapor in the atmosphere, and the adverse effects of weather conditions, as discussed in the previous section. Such a propagation loss can reach hundreds of decibels per kilometer or even higher. Additionally, this problem is further aggravated by the following two factors [174]: • Strong thermal noise: Noise power is proportional to signal bandwidth with the constant power density. Therefore, the unique advantage of massive bandwidth at the THz band imposes a side effect of strong thermal noise. • Hardware constraint: The transmit power at the THz band is quite constrained since the output power decreases with frequency and is at the level of decibel-milli-Watts in the foreseeable future. Hence, raising power to extend the communications distance is not feasible [102]. To extend the signal transmission distance beyond a few meters, high-gain directional antennas are necessary to compensate for such a high propagation loss in THz communications and sensing. Thanks to tiny wavelengths, massive numbers of elements can be tightly packed in a small area to generate high beamforming gains [321]–[323]. In this section, we will discuss the cutting-edge antenna forms, novel beamforming techniques, and necessary beam alignment schemes at the THz band [51]. A. Ultra-Massive MIMO Since the length of a resonant antenna is typically in the order of the wavelength at the resonance frequency, the dimension of an array with tens of elements is a few square meters and a few square centimeters at the sub-6G and

### Fig. 8
**Caption:** Fig. 8. The former involves transmitting known signals and adjusting beamforming parameters to align the beams. The latter involves estimating CSI from received signals and using it to refine the beamforming parameters. This part surveys the state-of-the-art advances in beam tracking techniques, while beam estimation is discussed in the subsequent part. Beam training involves scanning the channel with directional beams from a codebook to determine the beam pair at the transmitter and receiver that results in the highest SNR of the received signal [380]. Beam training can be broadly classified into two categories: exhaustive and hierarchical training, which are discussed as follows: 1) Exhaustive Training: Many studies have adopted exhaustive training, which involves sequentially probing all the predefined directions in the codebook to find the optimal beam pair that maximizes the SNR at the receiver [381].

It aims for enhanced spectral and energy efficiency, reduced hardware cost, and decreased power consumption as well as deployment and computational complexity. In the literature, such as [47], [53], [468], [485]–[487], THz sensing, imaging, localization, and communications are treated separately. Different from these, we in this section provide a holistic survey on the recent activities in integrated THz communications and sensing. Special attention is paid to use cases and KPIs, waveform design, algorithm development, RIS-boosted ISAC, and potential challenges and solutions. The architectural overview of THz ISAC is depicted in Fig. 9, and the selected major contributions related to THz ISAC are summarized in Table X. A. THz-ISAC Use Cases and KPIs Localization and sensing, including determining the 2D/3D location and EM properties of objects, alongside multi-scale communications enable a multitude of emerging use cases, which may have different functional and non-functional QoS requirements in terms of accuracy, range, latency, velocity, update rate, reliability, and availability. The use case families consist of various vertical applications, e.g., massive twinning, immersive telepresence, wireless extended reality (XR), cooperative robots, THz internet-of-things (Tera-IoT), local trust zones, vehicular communication and radar sensing [498], and THz integrated access and backhaul (IAB). In general, these fall into the category of data-demanding and delaysensitive applications. However, the QoS requirements differ from one use case to another. For instance, manufacturing and smart cities, as two sub-categories of massive twining, need different accuracy, data rates, latency, update rates, reliability, and availability [18]. A full list of selected use cases and their corresponding performance metrics can be referred to [18], [35], [56], [59], [110], [488], [499]–[502], closely tied to these of upcoming 6G and beyond systems, for which the ultimate goal would be realizing terabit-per-second links and millimeter-level sensing/localization accuracy [110], [503]. B. THz-ISAC Waveform Design THz channels usually have short delay spread and THz transceivers suffer from low power amplifier (PA) efficiency (rapid decline on its saturated output power). Besides, frequency selectivity becomes less severe. As a result, coherence bandwidth increases. Therefore, the single-carrier waveform is more preferred compared to the orthogonal frequency-division

It is particularly effective for identifying substances with distinct THz absorption or reflection properties. 3) Synergy between THz communications and THz sensing: Based on these considerations, the THz band offers not only massive spectral resources for wireless communications but also unique advantages for sensing, positioning, imaging, and spectroscopy [35]. Hence, it attracted a lot of interest recently as a key enabler for implementing integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) for 6G and beyond [61]. On top of implementing THz communications and THz sensing in a unified system, these dual-functional wireless networks offer a great synergy through sensing-aided communication [62], [63] and communication-aided sensing [64], as we will elaborate in Sec. IX. Using sensing information in communications may be one of the significant benefits of ISAC, which enables a more deterministic and predictable propagation channel. It facilitates the design of efficient communication algorithms and protocols, such as sensing-aided channel estimation [65], predictive beamforming served by sensing [66], [67], fast beam alignment and tracking [68], and link blockage mitigation [69]. On the other hand, mobile communication networks also provide significant opportunities and benefits for network sensing or sensing as a service [70]. Nodes share sensing results through the mobile network, where multiple network nodes (base stations, user equipment, etc.) can act as a collaborative sensing system [71]. This collaboration, achieved through sensing data fusion, reduces measurement uncertainties and provides larger coverage areas, as well as higher sensing accuracy and resolutions. B. Motivations and Contributions Recently, the wireless community has published several research articles and surveys on THz communications. As listed in Table I, the existing surveys tend to focus on specific aspects of THz communications, such as antenna fabrication [49], propagation characterization [52], measurement [57], channel modeling [58], beamforming [51], and hardware [47]. These surveys are more beneficial for researchers who are focusing on a particular aspect of THz communications and need an exhaustive collection of the existing research outcomes in this aspect. On the other hand, some magazine articles such as [45], [60] offer overviews that cover relatively wide ranges of aspects but are rather concise on many topics. Therefore, a comprehensive survey, which can provide researchers with a holistic view of all the necessary ingredients to build a THz system, is still missing. In addition, prior literature primarily concentrated on THz communications from the perspective of conventional wireless systems and applications, while THz sensing has received much less attention. Last but not least, most of the current literature does not take into account the

3) Synergy between THz communications and THz sensing:
Based on these considerations, the THz band offers not only
massive spectral resources for wireless communications but
also unique advantages for sensing, positioning, imaging, and
spectroscopy [35]. Hence, it attracted a lot of interest recently
as a key enabler for implementing integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) for 6G and beyond [61]. On top of
implementing THz communications and THz sensing in a
unified system, these dual-functional wireless networks offer
a great synergy through sensing-aided communication [62],
[63] and communication-aided sensing [64], as we will
elaborate in Sec. IX.
Using sensing information in communications may be one
of the significant benefits of ISAC, which enables a more
deterministic and predictable propagation channel. It facilitates
the design of efficient communication algorithms and proto-
cols, such as sensing-aided channel estimation [65], predictive
beamforming served by sensing [66], [67], fast beam align-
ment and tracking [68], and link blockage mitigation [69]. On
the other hand, mobile communication networks also provide
significant opportunities and benefits for network sensing or
sensing as a service [70]. Nodes share sensing results through
the mobile network, where multiple network nodes (base sta-
tions, user equipment, etc.) can act as a collaborative sensing
system [71]. This collaboration, achieved through sensing
data fusion, reduces measurement uncertainties and provides
larger coverage areas, as well as higher sensing accuracy and
resolutions.

of THz communications, such as antenna fabrication [49],

Until the fourth generation (4G), cellular systems operated in low-frequency bands below 6 GHz, which are referred to as the sub-6 GHz band when high-frequency bands are considered in 5G NR [1]. During the ITU-R WRC held in 2015, also known as WRC-15, an item on the agenda was designated to identify high-frequency bands above 24 GHz that could be used for IMT-2020 mobile services. After conducting follow-up studies after WRC-15, the ITU-R found that ultralow latency and high data-rate applications would require larger, contiguous spectrum blocks. At WRC-19, the ITUR assigned several pieces of high-frequency bands for the deployment of 5G mmWave communications worldwide. That is • 24.25-27.5 GHz • 37-43.5 GHz • 45.5-47 GHz • 47.2-48.2 GHz • 66-71 GHz Meanwhile, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specified the relevant spectrum for 5G NR, which was divided into two frequency ranges: • FR1 - the First Frequency Range, including the sub6 GHz frequency band from 450 MHz to 6 GHz • FR2 - the Second Frequency Range, covering 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz. Initial mmWave deployments are expected to operate in 28 GHz (3GPP NR band n257 and n261) and 39 GHz (3GPP n260) based on the time-division multiplexing (TDD) mode, followed by 26 GHz (3GPP n258), as specified in Table III. C. Prior Exploration of THz The term terahertz was initially used in the 1970s to describe the spectral line frequency coverage of a Michelson interferometer or the frequency coverage of point contact diode detectors [92]. Before that, spectroscopists had coined this term for emission frequencies below the far IR range, which is the lowest frequency part of the IR radiation with a frequency range of about 300 GHz to 20 THz. Millimeter wave refers to the frequency band from 30 GHz to 300 GHz. Hence, the border between the far IR and THz, and the border between mmWave and THz, are still rather blurry. Typically, the THz band refers to EM waves with a frequency band from 0.1 THz to 10 THz. However, other definitions, e.g., 300 GHz to 3 THz, are used parallelly. The difference in using frequency (THz) and wavelength (mmWave) for identifying the two bands leaves some ambiguity for the range from 100 GHz to 300 GHz, which is also referred to as the upper-mmWave or sub-THz by some researchers. It is envisaged that 5G mainly focuses on the frequency bands below 100 GHz while 6G and beyond will cross over this frequency point. The current trend seems to give more emphasis on using centimeter wave and low mmWaves for enhancing 6G networks, but the THz band is certainly critical for sensing. To avoid harmful interference to Earth Exploration Satellite Service (EESS) and radio astronomy operating in the spectrum between 275 GHz and 1 THz, the ITU-R WRC-15 has initiated the activity called ‘Studies towards an identification for use by administrations for land-mobile and fixed services applications operating in the frequency range 275–450 GHz’. At the WRC-19 conference, a new footnote was added to the radio regulations, allowing for the opening of the spectrum between 275 GHz and 450 GHz to land mobile and fixed services. Together with the already assigned spectrum below 275 GHz, a total of 160 GHz spectrum, containing two big contiguous spectrum bands with 44 GHz bandwidth (i.e., from 252 GHz to 296 GHz) and 94 GHz bandwidth, respectively, is available for THz communications without specific requirements to protect EESS [93]. The mmWave Coalition, a group of innovative companies and universities united in the objective of removing regulatory barriers to technologies using frequencies ranging from 95 GHz to 275 GHz, submitted comments in January 2019 to the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for developing a sustainable spectrum strategy and urged NTIA to facilitate the access to the

Additionally, to compensate for the severe signal attenuation due to large free-space path loss, atmospheric absorption, and weather effects, as detailed in Sec. IV, the use of large-scale antenna arrays is a good option for THz communications and sensing. With appropriate beam steering and alignment methods, as elaborated in Sec. VII, pencil-like beams with high gains are generated to extend the transmission range. This setting brings a unique advantage from the perspective of information security. That is, highly directional beams are able to effectively confine unauthorized users to be on the same narrow path as the intended users, therefore lowering the risks of eavesdropping [112]. The equipment needed to demodulate and amplify THz signals is large and bulky. Hence, it is difficult for an eavesdropper to intercept signals without blocking the intended recipient and therefore raising an alarm. Regardless of its inherent nature of security, the immunity from THz eavesdropping cannot be fully guaranteed (e.g. placing a passive reflector in the beam), unless counter-measures are applied [114]. Further aspects related to secure THz systems are discussed in SubSec. VIII-G. e) Terabit Wireless Backhaul: The installation of fiber optical connections is typically time-consuming and costly, and it may not always be feasible to deploy public optical networks within certain buildings or areas due to property

than that of low frequencies due to the decreased diffraction
effects for small wavelengths [57]. Additionally, to compensate
for the severe signal attenuation due to large free-space path
loss, atmospheric absorption, and weather effects, as detailed
in Sec. IV, the use of large-scale antenna arrays is a good
option for THz communications and sensing. With appropriate
beam steering and alignment methods, as elaborated in Sec.
VII, pencil-like beams with high gains are generated to extend
the transmission range. This setting brings a unique advantage
from the perspective of information security. That is, highly
directional beams are able to effectively confine unauthorized
users to be on the same narrow path as the intended users,
therefore lowering the risks of eavesdropping [112]. The
equipment needed to demodulate and amplify THz signals is
large and bulky. Hence, it is difficult for an eavesdropper to
intercept signals without blocking the intended recipient and
therefore raising an alarm. Regardless of its inherent nature
of security, the immunity from THz eavesdropping cannot
be fully guaranteed (e.g. placing a passive reflector in the
beam), unless counter-measures are applied [114]. Further
aspects related to secure THz systems are discussed in Sub-
Sec. VIII-G.

A further advantage is the ability to deliver an optical signal over a large distance by means of an optical fiber. Thus, optical signal generation and modulation may be performed separated from the THz signal generation, which may yield flexibility to the transmission system [23]. Another photonic method of generating THz signals is through quantum cascade laser (QCL). Conventional lasers emit photons through the recombination of electron-hole pairs across the band gap. Thus, the lower bound for the frequency of the emitted photons is defined by the band gap, which limits the ability of the lasers to work below the IR band. In contrast, QCLs are unipolar [315]. The photons are emitted by quantum jumps of electrons between two different energy levels. These energy levels are defined by the structure of the quantum wells. This provides the possibility to tune the frequency of the laser. Due to the low energy gap between the energy levels, QCLs are well suited for mid-IR applications. In recent decades, there was also a big progress on QCL development for the farIR or THz range [316]. QCLs are able to cover the frequency band from 1 THz to 5 THz with a peak radiation power of 1 W [317]–[319]. However, the operating frequency for QCL is in the cryogenic range, which limits their applications. VII. BEAM-FORMING AND ALIGNMENT FOR THZ COMMUNICATIONS AND SENSING The use of the THz band can alleviate the problem of spectrum scarcity and facilitate novel applications, such as nano-scale networks and in-device communications. However, its practical use is challenged by large propagation losses, which generally lead to very short distances of signal transmission [320]. The main causes of this problem include the high spreading loss that grows quadratically with carrier frequency, the gaseous absorption due to oxygen molecules and water vapor in the atmosphere, and the adverse effects of weather conditions, as discussed in the previous section. Such a propagation loss can reach hundreds of decibels per kilometer or even higher. Additionally, this problem is further aggravated by the following two factors [174]: • Strong thermal noise: Noise power is proportional to signal bandwidth with the constant power density. Therefore, the unique advantage of massive bandwidth at the THz band imposes a side effect of strong thermal noise. • Hardware constraint: The transmit power at the THz band is quite constrained since the output power decreases with frequency and is at the level of decibel-milli-Watts in the foreseeable future. Hence, raising power to extend the communications distance is not feasible [102]. To extend the signal transmission distance beyond a few meters, high-gain directional antennas are necessary to compensate for such a high propagation loss in THz communications and sensing. Thanks to tiny wavelengths, massive numbers of elements can be tightly packed in a small area to generate high beamforming gains [321]–[323]. In this section, we will discuss the cutting-edge antenna forms, novel beamforming techniques, and necessary beam alignment schemes at the THz band [51]. A. Ultra-Massive MIMO Since the length of a resonant antenna is typically in the order of the wavelength at the resonance frequency, the dimension of an array with tens of elements is a few square meters and a few square centimeters at the sub-6G and

advantage is the ability to deliver an optical signal over a large

generation and modulation may be performed separated from
the THz signal generation, which may yield flexibility to the

Another photonic method of generating THz signals is

emit photons through the recombination of electron-hole pairs
across the band gap. Thus, the lower bound for the frequency

the ability of the lasers to work below the IR band. In contrast,
QCLs are unipolar [315]. The photons are emitted by quantum
jumps of electrons between two different energy levels. These
energy levels are defined by the structure of the quantum wells.
This provides the possibility to tune the frequency of the laser.
Due to the low energy gap between the energy levels, QCLs
are well suited for mid-IR applications. In recent decades,
there was also a big progress on QCL development for the far-
IR or THz range [316]. QCLs are able to cover the frequency
band from 1 THz to 5 THz with a peak radiation power of 1 W

Therefore, THz imaging is suitable for the stand-off detection of items such as firearms, bombs, and explosive belts hidden beneath clothing in airports, train stations, and border crossings [54]. c) Terahertz Positioning: It is envisioned that 6G and beyond systems are required to offer high-accurate positioning and localization in both indoor and outdoor environments, in addition to communications services, which GNSS and conventional multi-cell-based localization techniques using lowfrequency bands fail to provide. Devices incorporating THz sensing and THz imaging will likely provide centimeter-level localization anywhere [125]. On the other hand, leveraging THz imaging for localization has unique benefits compared to other methods. THz imaging can localize users in nonline-of-sight (NLoS) areas, even if their travel paths to the base station experience more than one reflection (e.g., multiple bounces). High-frequency localization techniques are based on the concept of SLAM [115], in which the accuracy is improved by collecting high-resolution images of the environment, where THz imaging can provide such high-resolution images. SLAM-based techniques consist of three main steps: imaging the surrounding environment, estimation of ranges to the user, and fusion of images with the estimated ranges. Since SLAM deals with relatively slow-moving objects, there is sufficient time to process high-resolution THz measurement. Such measurement can hold sensing information, resulting in complex state models comprising the fine-grained location, size, and orientation of target objects, as well as their electromagnetic properties and material types [35]. To summarize how THz communications and THz sensing can support 6G and beyond systems, Table V shows the interconnection between THz applications and IMT-2030 usage scenarios (see Fig.1). IV. THZ PROPAGATION AND CHANNEL CHARACTERIZATION Compared with low-frequency channels, THz channels are much less understood, as they possess several distinct characteristics [57], [126]. Like microwave and mmWave, THz signals suffer from free-space path loss (FSPL), as inherent attenuation when an electromagnetic wave is radiated from an isotropic antenna. Unfortunately, THz antennas have a weak ability to capture the radiation power due to their small aperture. This leads to a FSPL that proportionally grows with the increase of the carrier frequency. Since the wavelength of a THz wave falls into the same order of magnitude as the dimensions of molecules in the atmosphere and human tissue, strong molecular absorption and particle scattering, which are negligible in low-frequency bands, become significant [58]. To be specific, water vapor and oxygen molecules suspended in the atmosphere impose an incredible loss of thousands of dB per kilometer in the worst case. In addition to this gaseous absorption from water molecules, liquid water droplets, in the form of suspended particles into clouds, rain-falling hydrometeors, snowflakes, and fogs, can attenuate the signal strength since their dimensions are comparable to the THz wavelength. Furthermore, surrounding physical objects become sufficiently large in size for scattering, and ordinary surfaces are also too rough to make specular reflections. As a result, a THz wave is susceptible to being blocked by buildings, furniture, vehicles, foliage, and even the human body. Characterizing the propagation of THz signals is mandatory for designing transmission algorithms, developing network protocols, evaluating system performance, and deploying commercial networks. Therefore, this section comprehensively characterizes THz signal propagation, including path loss, atmospheric absorption, weather effects, and blockage, aiming to provide the readers with the prerequisite knowledge of THz channels for designing THz systems for communications and sensing.

Analyzed how key channel parameters change as they move from short to longer distances. 2021 [132] Unveiled that metallic-covered surfaces lead to a considerable enhancement of multi-path, indicating a critical impact of building materials. Relying on pronounced sparsity for THz system design might not always be valid in this type of environment. 2021 [133] Wideband channel measurement campaigns at 140 GHz and 220 GHz are conducted in indoor scenarios including a meeting room and an office room. Developed single-band close-in path loss models to investigate the large-scale fading characteristics. 2021 [134] A wideband channel measurement campaign between 130 GHz and 143 GHz is investigated in a typical meeting room. 2021 [135] Introduced outdoor UMi propagation measurement at 142 GHz along a 39 m × 12 m rectangular route, where each consecutive and adjacent receiver location is 3 m apart from each other. 2022 [136] Investigated the LoS and NLoS path loss by carrying out measurement in indoor scenarios at frequencies ranging from 130 GHz to 320 GHz with a frequency-domain VNA-based sounder. 2022 [137] Path-loss analyses in a factory building based on sub-THz channel measurement with a maximal distance of 40 m using directional horn antennas at 142 GHz. Facilitated emerging sub-THz applications for future smart factories. 2022 [100] Investigated the urban microcell (UMi) large-scale path loss at 28, 38, 73, and 142 GHz. Introduced a detailed spatial statistical multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channel generation procedure based on the derived empirical channel statistics. Atmospheric Absorption 1982 [138] Calculated the absorption values due to atmospheric oxygen and water vapor with frequencies spanning from 1 GHz to 340 GHz. 1987 [139] Performed laboratory measurement of water vapor attenuation at 138 GHz and formed an empirical propagation model that utilizes a local line base to address frequencies up to 1 THz. 2011 [103] Revealed that oxygen molecules are the main cause of atmospheric absorption. Investigated channel capacity of the THz band for different power allocation schemes, including a scheme based on the transmission of femtosecond-long pulses. 2016 [140] Studied the molecular absorption noise from different perspectives and gave their derivations and the general ideas behind the noise modeling in the higher frequency bands, such as THz band (0.1 THz to 10 THz). 2019 [46] Discussed open issues and the state-of-the-art solutions to these issues for THz communication system design. Highlighted that propagation losses at THz frequencies are more heavily affected by atmospheric absorption compared to that of the mmWave. 2020 [141] Showed that high atmospheric absorption can be alleviated by a proper choice of the carrier frequency, e.g., the band from 275 GHz to 325 GHz while having drastically more bandwidth than 5G. 2021 [142] A wireless backhaul network for a given ultra-dense mobile network is automatically planned and analyzed in the ThoR project. 2021 [143] Developed an automatic planning algorithm for backhaul links operating at 300 GHz, which is tested and evaluated in a realistic scenario of an ultra-dense network, taking into account various atmospheric effects. Weather Effects 2015 [144] Measured THz pulse propagation through a 186 m distance under different weather conditions such as rain falling at 3.5 mm/h and snow falling at 2 cm/h, demonstrating the potential of LoS THz communications, sensing, and imaging through fog and smoke. 2015 [145] Measured the effects of rain attenuation on 0.1 THz to 1 THz frequencies through THz time-domain spectroscopy and a rain chamber, which was designed to generate controllable and reproducible rain conditions. 2015 [146] Experimentally demonstrated the propagation of THz signals through 137 m of dense fog with approximate visibility of 7 m, and reported the observed THz attenuation. 2017 [147] Quantified the attenuation of 150 GHz and 300 GHz THz waves in the sand for the outdoor scenario of low-THz sensing. 2018 [148] Assessed the attenuation through various intensities of snowfall experimentally at 300 GHz, which is characterized by measuring the ratio of the received power from the target through the snow precipitation and through the same path with no precipitation. 2019 [149] Assessed the attenuation through various intensities of snowfall experimentally at low-THz frequencies (100 GHz to 300 GHz), showing that snow attenuation at 300 GHz is less than 20 dB/km for snowfall rates below 20 mm/h. 2019 [150] Theoretically and experimentally studied the effects of water droplets suspended in the atmosphere on the propagation of mmWave and THz waves, using a frequency-modulated continuous-wave high-resolution radar operating at 330 GHz. 2019 [151] The characteristics of rain attenuation have been investigated using raindrop size distribution collected in Indonesia. Reports indicating that the regional variation of rain attenuation should be considered. 2019 [152] Evaluated the rain induced interference at 300 GHz. Results are calculated also at 60 GHz for comparison. Analyzed possible co-channel interference due to rain droplets, showing that the typical interference levels remain modest. 2020 [153] Studied rain attenuation with different rainfall rates at mmWave (77 GHz) and low-THz (300 GHz) frequencies. Revealed that the measured results at 77 GHz best agree with the ITU-R P838 model whereas the calculation based on Mie scattering and the Weibull distribution are best fit to the measured data at 300 GHz. Blockage Loss 2014 [154] Developed models with variations in the LoS probability expressions across different channel measurement campaigns. 2018 [155] Presented a novel spatial dynamic channel sounding system based on phased array transmitters and receivers operating at 60 GHz. Verified that the blockage duration is dependent on the density and speed of dynamic blockers that can last longer than 100 ms. 2018 [156] Studied the impact of micro-mobility such as shakes and rotations of user equipment even when the user is in a stationary position. 2019 [157] Proposed a novel spatially-consistent human body blockage state generation procedure, which extends the standardized 3D channel model by 3GPP to capture the correlation between the LoS links and the reflected cluster states affected by human body blockage. Showed that a dynamic blockage causes an extra loss of around 15 dB to 40 dB. 2020 [129] Employed a channel sounder that covers 140 GHz - 220 GHz and a frequency extender for THz channel measurement and built a platform for the exploration of THz communications within a short distance up to 5 m. Pointed out that the reflection from rough surfaces like concrete or brick walls attenuates THz signals with a power drop ranging from 40 dB to 80 dB. 2021 [99] Reported a comprehensive measurement campaign with the aim of analyzing the wave propagation at 300 GHz in typical vehicular deployments. Showed that the blockage caused by vehicles leads to a loss of 25 dB to 60 dB over the frequency band of 300 GHz. 2021 [158] Proposed several models characterized by various degrees of details to capture micromobility patterns of different applications. Assumed that the user behavior is more regulated as a micro-mobility. It shows that drift to the origin is a critical property that has to be captured by the model. 2022 [159] Measured and statistically investigated the micromobility process of various applications including video viewing, phone calls, virtual reality viewing, and racing games. Suggested that micro-mobility follows a Markov pattern where user behavior is not controlled.

Sensing integrated DFT-spread-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (SIDFT-s-OFDM) can yield lower PAPR than OFDM while maintaining single-carrier characteristic, as reported in [489], [490], [505]. In addition, it brings a ten-fold improvement in velocity estimation of the moving target and significant enhancement on data rate, beneficial from the FGI approach, which is capable of reducing the cyclic prefix (CP) overhead. In ISAC systems, communication and sensing channels may possess different properties. For instance, a sensing channel can expose a significant delay spread. Thus, different design criteria for communications and sensing waveforms should be considered in terms of cyclic prefix lengths and pilots [505]. Another type of intensively studied waveform, so-called orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), can well handle the Doppler effect and accommodate the channel dynamics in the delay-Doppler domain. Nevertheless, it still can not meet the strict requirements of power amplifier efficiency and signal processing complexity. Similar to SI-DFT-s-OFDM, DFT-s-OTFS was proposed to address the high PAPR issue faced in the original OTFS [490]. In contrast to OTFS, DFT-s-OTFS can achieve strong robustness to Doppler spread compared to OFDM and DFT-spread-OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) and reach lower PAPR compared to its OTFS counterpart [59], [490], [506]. By imposing superimposed pilots in the delayDoppler domain alongside the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) precoding operation, THz ISAC system facilitates lowcomplexity iterative channel estimation and data detection. Because of the aforementioned advantages, DFT-s-OTFS is the most promising candidate waveform for THz ISAC systems. C. THz-ISAC Algorithm Development The ISAC algorithms typically fall into three categories, i.e., the data-driven AI-based approaches, model-based approaches, and hybrid approaches (a combination of the former two). AI techniques rely on large-volume date sets for training customized neural network (NN) models for sensing, localization, and signal detection, while tackling the mathematically intractable non-linearity issues from, e.g., phase noise and offset, power amplifier, and mutual coupling.

In the past decade, the electronic mixing technology was widely applied to generate high-frequency THz signals by up-converting a low-frequency microwave signal, as the traditional way to realize THz transmission as listed in Table XI [521], [523], [524]. One of the most remarkable approaches was done by Bell Labs in 2011, where THz radiation at 625 GHz was generated by using an all-solid-state electric mixer. It achieved a data rate of 2.5 Gbps at a distance of 0.2 m under the transmission power of 1 mW [521]. In 2015, the researchers at the University of Stuttgart in Germany successfully transmitted 240 GHz THz signals to the receiver at a distance of 850 m. The trial achieved a peak data rate of 64 Gbps using quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and 8ary phase-shift keying (8PSK) modulation in a single-channel approach without the use of spatial diversity [523].

Compared
to
X-rays
and
Gamma rays, THz waves have much lower photon en-
ergy, making them non-ionizing [40]. This implies that
THz sensing is generally considered safe for biological
samples and humans, allowing for non-destructive and
non-invasive imaging and diagnosing.
• Low environmental interference: In contrast to visible
or IR radiation [41], THz waves are less vulnerable
to environmental factors such as ambient light, fog, or
smoke. It allows THz sensing for outdoor environments
or adverse conditions, expanding its usability in fields
such as remote sensing, atmospheric monitoring, and
outdoor stand-off security screening of dangerous items
like firearms, bombs, and explosive belts hidden beneath
clothing [35].

• the signal bandwidth becomes increasingly wide;
• the operating frequency band is increasingly high; and
• the spectral demand is increasingly large.
Each new generation of cellular systems demanded more
spectral resources and utilized a larger channel bandwidth
to support more system capacity and realize a higher data

Terahertz Imaging:
Using THz radiation to form
images has many technical advantages over microwaves and
visible light. THz imaging [108] exhibits high spatial resolu-
tion due to smaller wavelengths and ultra-wide bandwidths
with moderately sized hardware than imaging using low
frequencies. Compared with infrared and visible light, THz
waves have better penetration performance, making common
materials relatively transparent to THz signals. There are
many security screening applications, such as checking postal
packages for concealed objects, allowing THz imaging through
envelopes, packages, parcels, and small bags to identify poten-
tial hazardous items [39]. THz radiation is non-ionizing, and
therefore it has no known health risks to biological cells except
for heating, which has motivated its application for imaging
of the human body, where ionizing radiations, i.e., ultraviolet,

water vapor, along with small additional factors for the non-
resonant Debye spectrum of oxygen below 10 GHz, pressure-
induced nitrogen absorption over 100 GHz, and a wet contin-
uum to account for the excess absorption from water vapor,
the ITU-R P676 model [160] has been built to generate the
values of atmospheric attenuation at any frequency from 1 GHz
to 1000 GHz. Alternatively, the high-resolution transmission
molecular absorption (HITRAN) database [164], which is
a compilation of spectroscopic parameters, can be used to
predict and analyze the transmission in the atmosphere. To
compute the atmospheric absorption at THz, it needs to extract
spectroscopic data from the HITRAN database and then apply
radiative transfer theory.

B. THz Channel Modeling
Developing a wireless communication system requires an
accurate channel model that fully captures the major prop-
agation characteristics of the operating carrier frequency. It
allows wireless researchers and engineers to assess the per-
formance of different transmission algorithms and medium-
control protocols without having to conduct expensive and
time-consuming real-world field measurements on their own.
A large number of channel models, focusing on the sub-

have been built through curve fitting or analytical analysis
based on field measurement data. These models reflect all
propagation effects, both known and unknown, and therefore

a) Physical Models: Early research work on statistical
channel modeling for the mmWave or THz band focused
on enhancing and adapting the well-known Saleh-Valenzuela
(S-V) model through calibration [221], which is based on
the observation that multipath components arrive in the form
of clusters [217]. Some other research work maintained the
model based on clustering while utilizing different distribu-
tions, instead of the Poisson process, to describe the time of
arrival (ToA) in order to improve the accuracy compared with
measurement [219], [220], [222]. Another example, which is
referred to as the Zwick model [242], is based on multipath

2) Photonic Devices: To transition from extremely high-
frequency photonic radiation to a lower THz frequency, an
optical frequency downconverter, commonly known as pho-
tomixing, is required. Illustrated in Fig. 7, this process in-
volves feeding two laser signals with frequencies f1 and f2
towards a photomixing diode, such as the uni-traveling-carrier
photodiode (UTC-PD) [314]. Subsequently, the photodiode,
akin to traditional high-frequency mixing, generates a THz
signal at frequency fTHz = f1 −f2. Photomixing provides
high tunability and modulation bandwidth. Also, a variety
of complex modulation schemes may be implemented with
moderate efforts, as compared to electronic solutions. Fig. 7
shows two modulation approaches, modulation of both laser

corresponding performance metrics can be referred to [18],
[35], [56], [59], [110], [488], [499]–[502], closely tied to

millimeter-level sensing/localization accuracy [110], [503].
B. THz-ISAC Waveform Design
THz channels usually have short delay spread and THz
transceivers suffer from low power amplifier (PA) efficiency
(rapid decline on its saturated output power). Besides, fre-
quency selectivity becomes less severe. As a result, coherence
bandwidth increases. Therefore, the single-carrier waveform is
more preferred compared to the orthogonal frequency-division

ays can make beams
aligned with the target physical directions across the entire
bandwidth. Due to the user mobility and frequent blockage,
beam misalignment occurs when LoS path is unavailable
between the BS and MS. Provided that the user can be tracked
and blockage can be predicted in advance, beam misalignment
can be avoided. However, this requires high-precision sensing
information. In line with the 5G CSI acquisition signals, the
authors in [520] adopt synchronization signal block (SSB) for
blockage detection and reference signal (RS) for user tracking.
Until all the above-mentioned challenges are thoroughly
addressed in the forthcoming years, the vision that everything
will be sensed, connected, and intelligent can be fulfilled.

5G (a.k.a IMT-2020), in its recommendations M.1645 [16] and
M.2083 [17], respectively, the ITU-R started the development
process for 6G by defining the IMT-2030 vision as the first
step. The first recommendation for IMT-2030 was completed
on 22nd June 2023 during the 44th ITU-R WP5D meeting
in Geneva. As shown in Fig.1, the three IMT-2020 usage
scenarios, i.e., enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-
Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), and mas-
sive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) are upgraded to
Immersive Communication, Hyper Reliable and Low-Latency
Communication, and Massive Communication, respectively. In
addition, three new usage scenarios – Integrated Sensing and
Communication, Ubiquitous Connectivity, and Integrated AI
and Communication – are introduced.

Six usage scenarios for IMT-2030 and four overarching aspects,

of Integrated Sensing and Communication. Driven by the

vices, and signal processing, 6G will be a dual-functional
system that is able to not only communicate but also sense
as well [18]. This usage scenario enables 6G and beyond to

[19]. It offers high-resolution sensing, localization, imaging,

poses a significant risk to human health, as it has strong
energy power to dislodge electrons and generate free
radicals that can lead to cancer [36]. The adverse health
effects of ionizing radiation are controllable if used with
care, so extreme high-frequency signals have been used
in specific fields such as radiotherapy, photography, semi-
conductor manufacturing, and nuclear medicine, among
others. However, it is still too dangerous for personal
communications [21].

Fig. 2. The electromagnetic spectrum and the positions of mmWave, THz,
and optical bands.
Unlike ionizing radiation, THz frequencies are non-ionizing
because their photon energy is not sufficient (0.1 to 12.4meV,
which is over three orders of magnitude weaker than ionizing
photon energy levels) to release an electron from an atom or
a molecule, where typically 12eV is required for ionization.
The THz band offers abundant spectral resources, ranging
from tens of gigahertz to several terahertz, depending on the
transmission distance. This makes the available bandwidth
more than ten times greater than that of mmWave bands, while
the operating frequency is at least one order of magnitude
below the optical bands. In addition, the technologies required
to make Tbps-level transmission over the THz band a reality
is rapidly advancing [37]. For example, novel antennas and

combination of the individual spectral lines from oxygen and
water vapor, along with small additional factors for the non-
resonant Debye spectrum of oxygen below 10 GHz, pressure-
induced nitrogen absorption over 100 GHz, and a wet contin-
uum to account for the excess absorption from water vapor,
the ITU-R P676 model [160] has been built to generate the
values of atmospheric attenuation at any frequency from 1 GHz
to 1000 GHz. Alternatively, the high-resolution transmission
molecular absorption (HITRAN) database [164], which is
a compilation of spectroscopic parameters, can be used to
predict and analyze the transmission in the atmosphere. To
compute the atmospheric absorption at THz, it needs to extract
spectroscopic data from the HITRAN database and then apply
radiative transfer theory.

Besides the ITU-R model, there are other models, such as a
simplified one given in [170] to describe the rain attenuation.
The measurement at 28 GHz demonstrated that heavy rainfall
with a rain rate of more than 25 mm/h brings an attenuation of
about 7 dB/km. Extreme attenuation of up to 50 dB/km occurs
at a particular frequency of 120 GHz and an extreme rain rate
of 100 mm/h to 150 mm/h. As a rule of thumb, rain provides
an excess attenuation of approximately 10 dB to 20 dB over a
distance of 1 km at the THz band. Furthermore, the attenuation
of cloud and fog can be calculated by the ITU-R P840 model
[171] under the assumption that the signals go through a

In contrast, THz communications and sensing require the
capability of accurate phase recovery, especially the case for
digital modulation when both in-phase and quadrature (IQ)
branches are exploited. Furthermore, compactness and low
energy consumption play critical roles. Thus, the utilization
of semiconductor-based integrated circuits is advantageous
for THz communications and sensing applications in 6G and
beyond systems. We present the fundamentals and state-of-the-
art advances in photonic and electronic components as follows.
1) Electronic Devices: There are two classes of electronic
devices capable of generating THz radiation. The first class
is high-power devices primarily based on the principle of
electron tubes, capable of producing signal power ranging
from 10 W to 1 MW. These high-power devices are typically

constructed from various semiconductor materials, which pro-
vide a more compact and cost-effective solution. While they
may have limitations in terms of transmission power, semi-
conductor devices are suitable for THz communications and
sensing [279]. III-V-semiconductors such as Gallium Arsenide
(GaAs), Gallium Nitride (GaN), and Indium Phosphide (InP),
are commonly used to fabricate THz components. In addition,
Silicon Germanium (SiGe) based devices show promising
performance. Compared to the aforementioned technologies,

advantage is the ability to deliver an optical signal over a large
distance by means of an optical fiber. Thus, optical signal
generation and modulation may be performed separated from
the THz signal generation, which may yield flexibility to the
transmission system [23].
Another photonic method of generating THz signals is
through quantum cascade laser (QCL). Conventional lasers
emit photons through the recombination of electron-hole pairs
across the band gap. Thus, the lower bound for the frequency
of the emitted photons is defined by the band gap, which limits
the ability of the lasers to work below the IR band. In contrast,
QCLs are unipolar [315]. The photons are emitted by quantum

on. This is accomplished by aligning the
beams at the transmitter and receiver to the direction of
the channel paths, where channel state information (CSI) is
critical for implementing the fine alignment [375]. However,
traditional channel sensing methods used at lower frequencies
are not feasible at THz frequencies due to the significant path
losses that render pilot signals undetectable during the link
establishment stage.
Significant research efforts have been made in recent years
to understand the unique characteristics of the THz chan-
nel and to develop appropriate beam alignment algorithms.
These efforts aim to establish beam alignment during the link
establishment stage [376], [377] and to maintain alignment
while the beams are in motion (beam tracking). Two cat-
egories of beam alignment techniques have been identified:
beam training [378] and beam estimation [379], as shown in
Fig. 8. The former involves transmitting known signals and
adjusting beamforming parameters to align the beams. The
latter involves estimating CSI from received signals and using
it to refine the beamforming parameters. This part surveys the
state-of-the-art advances in beam tracking techniques, while
beam estimation is discussed in the subsequent part.
Beam training involves scanning the channel with direc-
tional beams from a codebook to determine the beam pair at
the transmitter and receiver that results in the highest SNR
of the received signal [380]. Beam training can be broadly
classified into two categories: exhaustive and hierarchical
training, which are discussed as follows:
1) Exhaustive Training: Many studies have adopted ex-
haustive training, which involves sequentially probing all the
predefined directions in the codebook to find the optimal
beam pair that maximizes the SNR

### THz Propagation and Channel Characterization (excerpts)

```text
IV. THZ PROPAGATION AND CHANNEL
CHARACTERIZATION
Compared with low-frequency channels, THz channels are
much less understood, as they possess several distinct char-
acteristics [57], [126]. Like microwave and mmWave, THz
signals suffer from free-space path loss (FSPL), as inherent
attenuation when an electromagnetic wave is radiated from
an isotropic antenna. Unfortunately, THz antennas have a
weak ability to capture the radiation power due to their small
aperture. This leads to a FSPL that proportionally grows with
the increase of the carrier frequency.
Since the wavelength of a THz wave falls into the same
order of magnitude as the dimensions of molecules in the
atmosphere and human tissue, strong molecular absorption
and particle scattering, which are negligible in low-frequency
bands, become significant [58]. To be specific, water vapor
and oxygen molecules suspended in the atmosphere impose
an incredible loss of thousands of dB per kilometer in the
worst case. In addition to this gaseous absorption from water
molecules, liquid water droplets, in the form of suspended
particles into clouds, rain-falling hydrometeors, snowflakes,
and fogs, can attenuate the signal strength since their dimen-
sions are comparable to the THz wavelength. Furthermore,
surrounding physical objects become sufficiently large in size
for scattering, and ordinary surfaces are also too rough to make
specular reflections. As a result, a THz wave is susceptible to
being blocked by buildings, furniture, vehicles, foliage, and
even the human body.
Characterizing the propagation of THz signals is mandatory
for designing transmission algorithms, developing network
protocols, evaluating system performance, and deploying com-
mercial networks. Therefore, this section comprehensively
characterizes THz signal propagation, including path loss,
atmospheric absorption, weather effects, and blockage, aiming
to provide the readers with the prerequisite knowledge of THz
channels for designing THz systems for communications and
sensing.

A. High Free-Space Path Loss
When an isotropic radiator feeds an EM wave into free
space, the energy evenly spreads over the surface of an
ever-increasing sphere. The metric effective isotropic radiated
power (EIRP) indicates the maximal energy in a particular
direction relative to a unity-gain isotropic antenna. Hence, it
equals the product of the transmit power Pt and the transmit
antenna gain Gt in the direction of a receive antenna. The law
of conservation of energy states that the total energy contained
on the surface of a sphere of any radius d remains constant
[127]. Power flux density, namely the power flow per unit area
of the incident field at the antenna, is equivalent to the EIRP
divided by the surface area of a sphere with radius d, i.e.,
PtGt
4πd2 . The received power captured by a receive antenna is
proportional to its aperture Ar, and it is equal to
Pr =
PtGt
4πd2

Ar.

Meanwhile, the gain of a receive antenna Gr depends on its
effective aperture area according to the following relationship
Ar = Gr
λ2
4π

,
(2)
where λ stands for the wavelength of the transmitted signal.
Substituting (2) into (1) yields the well-known Friis transmis-
sion equation introduced by Harald T. Friis in 1946 [128],
i.e.,
Pr = PtGtGr
λ
4πd

.
(3)
Due to the large dynamic range across several orders of
magnitude, we usually express the strength of signals and noise
in decibels (dB). Free-space path loss is defined as the ratio
between the transmit and receive power on a logarithmic scale:
PL = 10 lg Pt
Pr
= 20 lg
4πd
λ

−10 lg (GtGr) ,
(4)
which implies that the FSPL increases 20 dB per decade (ten
times) as a function of the carrier frequency. For example, the
loss increases by 20 dB from 30 GHz to 300 GHz under the
assumption that d, Gt, and Gr are kept fixed. Note that the
high path loss at THz frequencies is due to the small aperture
area of the receive antenna, which is proportional to the square
of wavelength, based on (2) and assuming that Gr is kept fixed.
FSPL does not completely account for the realistic char-
acteristics of wireless propagation because the physical en-
vironment of a terrestrial wireless communication system
is distinct from free space. In addition to the LoS path,
an electromagnetic wave may be reflected, diffracted, and
scattered by the surrounding objects in an urban or indoor
scenario, creating NLoS paths between a pair of transmit and
receive antennas. Due to the differences in energy attenuation,
propagation delays, and phase rotations, the additional copies
of an electromagnetic wave, which are referred to as multi-
path components, cause an extra drop in the received signal
power. The novel use cases for the THz band in 6G and beyond
networks, such as kiosk downloading, nano-scale networks,
and wireless backhaul, introduce many peculiarities, which
need to be well investigated. Hence, extensive measurement
and accurate modeling of the path loss in terms of frequency,
distance, and propagation environment have to be carried out.
In this context, existing research works are summarized in
Table VI.
B. Atmospheric Absorption
Although gaseous molecules absorb some energy of an
EM wave, atmospheric absorption is negligible over the sub-
6G band such that traditional cellular systems do not take
it into account when calculating the link budget. However,
this effect substantially magnifies for the THz wave, and the
absorption loss becomes extremely large at certain frequencies.
Such attenuation arises from the interaction of an EM wave
with a gaseous molecule [161]. When the THz wavelength
approaches the size of molecules in the atmosphere, the
incident wave causes rotational and vibrational transitions in
polar molecules. These processes have a quantum nature where
resonances take place at particular frequencies depending on
the internal molecular structure, leading to large absorption
peaks at certain frequencies [162].
As a main gaseous component of the atmosphere, oxygen
plays a major role in atmospheric absorption under clear
air conditions. In addition, water vapor suspended in the
air strongly affects the propagation of an electromagnetic
wave. The attenuation caused by water vapor dominates the
THz band, with the exception of a few specific spectral
regions where the effect of oxygen is more evident. A more
extensive study of atmospheric absorption is often carried
out in radio astronomy and remote sensing. However, from
the perspective of wireless communications, the absorption
of some additional molecular species, e.g., oxygen isotopic
species, oxygen vibrationally excited species, stratospheric
ozone, ozone isotopic species, ozone vibrationally excited
species, a variety of nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur oxides, is
usually negligible compared with that of water vapor and
oxygen [163].
Responding to the need to accurately estimate the gaseous
absorption at any air pressure, temperature, and humidity, the
ITU-R conducted a study item and recommended a mathemat-
ical procedure to model these attenuation characteristics. As a
combination of the individual spectral lines from oxygen and
water vapor, along with small additional factors for the non-
resonant Debye spectrum of oxygen below 10 GHz, pressure-
induced nitrogen absorption over 100 GHz, and a wet contin-
uum to account for the excess absorption from water vapor,
the ITU-R P676 model [160] has been built to generate the
values of atmospheric attenuation at any frequency from 1 GHz
to 1000 GHz. Alternatively, the high-resolution transmission
molecular absorption (HITRAN) database [164], which is
a compilation of spectroscopic parameters, can be used to
predict and analyze the transmission in the atmosphere. To
compute the atmospheric absorption at THz, it needs to extract
spectroscopic data from the HITRAN database and then apply
radiative transfer theory.
The atmospheric attenuation from 1 GHz to 1000 GHz is
illustrated in Fig. 4. Assume the air is perfectly dry with a

1013.25hPa, temperature 15 °C, and water-vapor density 7.5 g/m3, according to [160], while Dry Air considers the effect of oxygen absorption only with a
water-vapor density of 0 g/m3. Except for frequencies centered at 60 GHz and 118.7 GHz, the effect of water vapor dominates.
water vapor density of 0 g/m3, then only the effect of oxygen
molecules exists, as indicated by the Dry Air curve in the
figure. On the other hand, the Standard Air line shows the
usual atmospheric condition at the sea level (with an air
pressure of 1013.25 hPa, the temperature of 15 °C, and a
water-vapor density of 7.5 g/m3). Except for two frequency
windows centered around 60 GHz and 118.7 GHz, where many
oxygen absorption lines merged, the attenuation due to water
vapor dominates the THz band. As we can see, this absorption
can bring a peak loss of 17.1 dB/m at 560 GHz, accounting
for an extreme level of approximately 17 000 dB/km, which
is prohibitive for wireless communications. In contrast, the
attenuation at the sub-6 GHz band is less than 0.0001 dB/m,
seven orders of magnitude smaller.
Early in the 1980s, some researchers reported their studies
for various atmospheric conditions and elevation angles. Ernest
K. Smith calculated the absorption values due to atmospheric
oxygen and water vapor for frequencies spanning from 1 GHz
to 340 GHz [138]. Hans J. Liebe and Donald H. Layton [139]
performed laboratory measurement of water vapor attenuation
at 138 GHz and formed an empirical propagation model that
utilizes a local line base to address frequencies up to 1 THz.
For some studies focusing on very short-range indoor coverage
or nano-communications [165], this effect is typically not a
major factor. However, for macro-scale THz communications
and sensing, especially in outdoor environments, atmospheric
absorption should be taken into consideration. We provide a
summary of state-of-the-art studies in Table VI.
C. Weather Effects
Besides the gaseous absorption, an additional atmospheric
impact in an outdoor environment is the weather [166]. Ex-
tensive studies focused on satellite communications channels
since the 1970s provided many insights into the propagation
characteristics of mmWave and THz signals under various
weather conditions [167]. Like water vapor in the atmosphere,
the outcomes revealed that liquid water droplets, in the form
of suspended particles in clouds, fogs, snowflakes, or rain
falling hydrometeors, absorb or scatter the incident signals
since their physical dimensions are in the same order as the
THz wavelength. Such attenuation is not as strong as the path
loss and atmospheric absorption but still needs to be taken into
account for proper channel characterization [168].
A cloud is an aggregate of tiny water particles (with a
dimension as small as 1 µm) or ice crystals (from 0.1 mm
to 1 mm). Water droplets, in the form of raindrops, fogs,
hailstones, and snowflakes, are oblate spheroids with radii up
to a few tens of millimeters or generally perfect spheres with
radii below 1 mm. The size of water droplets is comparable
to the THz wavelength (0.1 mm to 1 mm). As a result, water
droplets attenuate the power of THz waves through absorption
and scattering. The ITR-R provided a power-low equation to
model the rain attenuation as a function of distance, rainfall
rate in millimeters per hour (mm/h), and the mean dimension
of raindrops [169]. Fig. 5 shows the rain attenuation described
by the ITU-R P838 model from 1 GHz to 1000 GHz and rain
rate from light rain (1 mm/h) to heavy rain (200 mm/h).
Such attenuation can be treated as an additional loss that is
simply added on top of the path loss and gaseous absorption.
Besides the ITU-R model, there are other models, such as a
simplified one given in [170] to describe the rain attenuation.
The measurement at 28 GHz demonstrated that heavy rainfall
with a rain rate of more than 25 mm/h brings an attenuation of
about 7 dB/km. Extreme attenuation of up to 50 dB/km occurs
at a particular frequency of 120 GHz and an extreme rain rate
of 100 mm/h to 150 mm/h. As a rule of thumb, rain provides
an excess attenuation of approximately 10 dB to 20 dB over a
distance of 1 km at the THz band. Furthermore, the attenuation
of cloud and fog can be calculated by the ITU-R P840 model
[171] under the assumption that the signals go through a

averaging over a period of time such as one hour. The values from light rain
(1 mm/h) to heavy rain (200 mm/h) are illustrated. The peak of attenuation
occurs on the frequency band from 100 GHz to 300 GHz since the wavelength
in this band matches the size of raindrops.
uniform fog or cloud environment.
In addition to mmWave signals [168], many recent efforts
of investigating THz waves in the presence of rains and fogs
have been conducted, as listed in Table VI. Besides, the
propagation loss during snowfall has been studied through
measurement campaigns. F. Norouzian et al. assessed the
attenuation through various intensities of snowfall experi-
mentally at 300 GHz in their work [148], as well as sub-
THz frequencies (100 GHz to 300 GHz) in [149]. Unlike
other weather conditions, there is no theoretical basis for
snow because of the challenging nature of defining snowflake
shape and size distributions. An equivalent ITU-R model to
calculate the snow attenuation does not exist and the snow
particles are merely considered as raindrops. As a rule of
thumb, measurement results indicate that snow attenuation
at 300 GHz is less than 20 dB/km for snowfall rates below
20 mm/h [149]. Last but not least, much work has been done
to investigate one of the most common types of contaminant
in outdoor environments, i.e., dust or sand. The authors of
[147] quantified the attenuation at 150 GHz and 300 GHz in
the presence of sand for outdoor THz sensing.
D. Blockage Loss
Due to the small wavelength of THz waves, the dimen-
sions of surrounding physical objects are sufficiently large
for scattering, while specular reflections on ordinary surfaces
become difficult. On the other hand, THz systems rely heavily
on pencil beams to extend the effective propagation distance.
As a result, a direct path between the transmitter and receiver
is desired. However, the LoS THz link is highly susceptible to
being blocked by macro objects, such as buildings, furniture,
vehicles, and foliage, and micro-objects, e.g., humans, in
comparison with traditional sub-6G signals [154].
A single blockage might cause a signal loss of a few tens
of dB. The extent of foliage loss is related to the depth of
vegetation [170], where 17 dB, 22 dB, and 25 dB are observed
at 28 GHz, 60 GHz, and 90 GHz, respectively. The blockage
loss due to vehicles [156] is determined by the vehicle type
and geometry, from 20 dB in the front-shield glass to 50 dB
in the engine area. The human body blockage imposes a
more profound influence because of the dynamic movement of
humans and the close interaction of THz devices with humans.
The loss attributed to the self-body blockage [155] is expected
to reach approximately 40 dB in the THz band. Such blockage
losses can dramatically decay the signal power and may even
lead to a thorough outage. Hence, it is necessary to clarify the
traits of blockage and find effective solutions to avoid being
blocked or quickly recover the connection when a link gets
blocked.
Statistical models can be applied to estimate the impact
of blockage loss. For instance, the self-body blockage loss
may be approximated as a Boolean model where a human is
treated as a three-dimensional cylinder with centers forming
a two-dimensional (2D) Poisson point process (PPP). A LoS
blockage probability model assumes that a link of distance
d will be LoS with probability pL(d) and NLoS otherwise.
The expressions of pL(d) are usually obtained empirically for
different settings. The blockage probability for a LoS link with
a self-body blockage can be estimated by the method given in
[172]. In [173], 3GPP specified an urban macro-cell scenario,
where a calculation method for a LoS blockage probability
is given. The same model applies to the urban micro-cell
scenario, with a smaller distance range. There are some varia-
tions in the expressions of the LoS probability across different
channel measurement campaigns and environments, e.g., the
model developed by NYU [154]. Some other prior works also
revealed quantitative results to estimate the blockage loss at
THz frequencies, as given in Table VI.

VI. THZ TRANSCEIVER: ANTENNAS AND DEVICES
This section aims to provide readers with the necessary
knowledge required to design and build THz transceivers,
which is recognized as one of the most challenging issues to
block the practical use of THz communications and sensing.
We discuss the cutting-edge antenna technologies that are
appropriate for transmitting and receiving THz signals, along
with the fundamental and innovative aspects of photonic-
electronic devices and components used in constructing THz
transceivers.
A. THz Antennas
The conventional concepts of EM antennas can also be
applied in the THz regime, as mentioned in the references like
[249]. Nevertheless, the exceptionally high THz frequencies
raise specific limitations and issues that must be carefully
considered. The tiny wavelength necessitates the use of ex-
tremely small structures, imposing disruptive challenges in
the manufacturing processes. Fortunately, this reduction in
structure size opens up opportunities for the implementation
of innovative manufacturing techniques like low-temperature
co-fired ceramic (LTCC), antenna-on-chip design, substrate-
integrated waveguide (SIW), and others. Another major issue
is the skin effect in conductive materials [49]. This phe-
nomenon occurs as the skin depth, indicating the depth to
which current penetrates in a conductive material, decreases
significantly. As a result, the conductivity of metallic materials
decreases, leading to extra losses in the antenna system. To
address this challenge, researchers have been investigating the
utilization of novel materials, such as graphene. Graphene,
with its outstanding electrical and thermal properties, shows
great potential in alleviating the skin effect and enhancing the

22
performance of THz antennas. Its high electron mobility and
low resistivity render it an appealing choice for overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional conductive materials.
To provide readers with an insightful view, we present
the fundamentals of different THz antenna techniques and a
summary of current research advances in the following.
1) Horn Antennas: Horn antennas are widely used in wire-
less applications due to their favorable characteristics. They
belong to the category of high directivity antennas, capable of
achieving gains of up to 25 dBi. Similar to hollow waveguides,
these antennas have low power loss, making them appropri-
ate for low-noise and high-power applications. Furthermore,
they can operate across a wide frequency range, which is
advantageous for broadband signals. Various manufacturing
technologies have been considered to address the challenges
posed by the short wavelength of THz signals. Among these,
the authors of [250] introduced elective laser-melting 3D
printing technology to produce conical horn antennas, which
are capable of operating in the frequency bands of E (60 GHz
to 90 GHz), D (110 GHz to 170 GHz), and H (220 GHz to
325 GHz). Another appropriate manufacturing technology for
THz horn antennas is LTCC, as reported in [251]. By utilizing
substrate-integrated waveguide technology, a horn structure is
created within the multi-layer LTCC substrate. It achieves a
peak gain of 25 dBi and supports a bandwidth of 100 GHz.
Remarkably, the dimensions of the LTCC horn antenna are
compact, measuring only 5 × 5 × 2.8mm.
2) Planar Antennas: Planar transmission line technology,
commonly used for THz frequencies, offers flexible antenna
designs. Among these designs, patch antennas based on mi-
crostrip line technology are particularly well-known. However,
planar antennas generally exhibit inferior performance com-
pared to horn antennas. This is primarily due to the EM wave
partially propagating within a dielectric substrate, resulting
in increased overall loss. Additionally, the small thickness in
THz planar structures leads to substrate mode issues [252],
where some of the wave energy is trapped in the substrate
and cannot be effectively utilized. Despite these drawbacks,
planar antennas remain popular, primarily due to the flexibility
in producing the planar structures. The planar shapes can
be easily designed and realized [253]–[256]. Moreover, patch
antennas can be efficiently packaged to build an antenna array,
allowing flexible control on the antenna pattern [257]–[259].
Another advantage of THz planar antennas is the feasibility
of designing high-gain on-chip antennas [260], [261]. Sand-
wiched between the silicon and polycarbonate substrates, a
15-element array comprising circular and rectangular patches
on the top surface of the polycarbonate layer achieved a gain
of 11.71 dBi [262].
3) Substrate-Integrated Antennas: The small wavelength of
THz signals causes some challenges in the design of planar
antennas. However, it turns into an advantage by leveraging
the capability of low-cost manufacturing and the flexibility
of planar structures to build SIW. The key idea behind SIW
is to connect the upper and the lower conductive layers of a
substrate by the via walls, as discussed in a comprehensive
review of this technology in [263]. This process builds a
rectangular waveguide inside the substrate, with the distance
between vias defining the upper cutoff frequency. The SIW
technology can be integrated with a variety of antennas and
array designs, such as horn antennas [264], [265], slot antennas
[266], [267], patch antennas [268], [269], and others [270]–
[273].
4) Carbon-Based Antennas: Graphene and carbon nan-
otubes, which are rolled sheets of graphene, are two promising
materials for use over the THz frequency band. Due to the
skin effect, metallic materials, especially copper, suffer low
conductivity and therefore inferior performance. In contrast,
graphene features high conductivity due to the propagation of
plasmon mode in a high-frequency range. The conductivity can
be tuned not only by chemical doping, but also by applying
electric and magnetic fields, enabling the production of tunable
antennas [274]. These properties make graphene suitable for
fabricating THz antennas. The most discussed use is to replace
the metallic conductors with graphene or carbon nanotubes in,
for example, planar antenna structures [275], [276]. Besides,
the approach of building a dipole antenna based on carbon
nanotubes was reported [277], [278].
B. THz Components and Transceiver Design
For a long time, there has existed a terahertz gap [46]
between the microwave and infrared regions. The gap arises
because traditional electronics are not efficient at generating
or detecting THz signals, while optical techniques like lasers
and photonic detectors are generally not applicable due to
limitations related to the wavelengths involved. On the one
hand, these frequencies are too low for photonic devices. On
the other hand, they are too high for electronic devices. In
this regard, the THz band used to be unreachable for either
photonic or electronic technologies. Prior THz research was
concentrated on applications such as imaging or spectrometry
[39]. This fact is attributed to two major reasons:
• These applications require comparably high output power
but are not demanding on the receiver side, since the
amplitude rather than the phase of a signal acts as the
information carrier.
• The equipment or operational conditions are not so chal-
lenging, compared with small, lightweight, cheap, and
battery-powered mobile terminals. Some technologies, es-
pecially photonic generation and detection are applicable.
In contrast, THz communications and sensing require the
capability of accurate phase recovery, especially the case for
digital modulation when both in-phase and quadrature (IQ)
branches are exploited. Furthermore, compactness and low
energy consumption play critical roles. Thus, the utilization
of semiconductor-based integrated circuits is advantageous
for THz communications and sensing applications in 6G and
beyond systems. We present the fundamentals and state-of-the-
art advances in photonic and electronic components as follows.
1) Electronic Devices: There are two classes of electronic
devices capable of generating THz radiation. The first class
is high-power devices primarily based on the principle of
electron tubes, capable of producing signal power ranging
from 10 W to 1 MW. These high-power devices are typically

necessary for specialized applications, such as satellite com-
munications. Another class consists of semiconductor devices,
constructed from various semiconductor materials, which pro-
vide a more compact and cost-effective solution. While they
may have limitations in terms of transmission power, semi-
conductor devices are suitable for THz communications and
sensing [279]. III-V-semiconductors such as Gallium Arsenide
(GaAs), Gallium Nitride (GaN), and Indium Phosphide (InP),
are commonly used to fabricate THz components. In addition,
Silicon Germanium (SiGe) based devices show promising
performance. Compared to the aforementioned technologies,
the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) tech-
nology has limitations such as low transmit power and high
noise figure. However, recent research argues that the CMOS
technology may also be suitable for THz communications and
sensing applications [106].
Most semiconductor-based THz transceivers follow the con-
ventional design for lower frequencies, such as the heterodyne
transceiver approach, as shown in Fig. 6. This entails passing
a modulated baseband signal to the front-end circuitry. Then,
it is up-converted to the THz carrier frequency by mixing
with the local oscillator (LO) signal. The signal is amplified
and sent over an antenna. At the receiver, the same steps
are applied in a reverse order, and the down-converted signal
is passed to the baseband circuitry for further processing.
The most critical aspect lies in LO generation, as it involves
synthesizing a THz signal. To achieve this, a multiplexer is
employed to upconvert a high-frequency signal into the THz
range. However, it’s important to note that each multiplexer
stage introduces additional inter-modulation products, which
in turn raise the noise figure and distort the generated signal.
Consequently, the number of multiplexer stages becomes a
limiting factor for THz signal generation.
Table IX offers a summary of the literature on the transmit-
ter and receiver front end in terms of different semiconductor
technologies. Among III-V semiconductor materials, InP com-
ponents demonstrate superior results in terms of output power
and noise figure. Furthermore, InP transistors can reach a max-
imum oscillating frequency fmax of up to 1.5 THz [293]. A
transceiver design based on a high-electron-mobility transistor
(HEMT) was reported. HEMT supports THz frequencies up
to 850 GHz, with particular attention given to the frequency
band around 300 GHz [280], [294], [295].
SiGe and CMOS are both silicon-based technologies suit-
able for the THz frequency band. Due to the intrinsic char-
acteristics of silicon, the maximum oscillation frequency is
limited below 1 THz. There are studies that show heterojunc-
tion bipolar transistors (HBTs) based on 130 nm SiGe process
reaching fmax of 620 GHz [296] as well as 720 GHz [297].
The SiGe components fabricated for HBTs exhibit advantages
such as good linearity, high gain, and low noise. However,
the power gain is limited, which prevents the operation above
500 GHz. Recent research focused particularly on the compo-
nents and devices for THz communications and sensing over
the D-band, which refers to the range of frequencies around
110 GHz to 170 GHz. As a result, novel transceiver design
was introduced such as those presented in [284], [285], [298],
[299]. The authors of [300] demonstrated a complete commu-
nication link that realizes a high throughput of 200 Gbps. Some
researchers present their transceiver design operating around
300 GHz [288], [290], [301]–[303]. A detailed survey on SiGe
transceiver for different purposes is provided in [304].
THz devices built from CMOS exhibit lower performance
compared to other semiconductor technologies. CMOS field-
effect transistors (FETs) can only reach a maximum oscillating
frequency of around 450 GHz, with limited power gain. Nev-
ertheless, CMOS technology is known for its low production
costs, which is its major advantage. The transceivers operating
at 240 GHz [288], [305], [306] or 300 GHz [307]–[310] were
implemented. The authors of [289]–[291] showcased some
CMOS transcivers operating in 300 GHz, which achieve high
data rates such as 105 Gbps or 32 Gbps. The highest reported
operating frequency is 390 GHz, reaching a data throughput
of 28 Gbps. Further achievements of CMOS transceiver are
summarized in [106], [311], [312].
2) Photonic Devices: To transition from extremely high-
frequency photonic radiation to a lower THz frequency, an
optical frequency downconverter, commonly known as pho-
tomixing, is required. Illustrated in Fig. 7, this process in-
volves feeding two laser signals with frequencies f1 and f2
towards a photomixing diode, such as the uni-traveling-carrier
photodiode (UTC-PD) [314]. Subsequently, the photodiode,
akin to traditional high-frequency mixing, generates a THz
signal at frequency fTHz = f1 −f2. Photomixing provides
high tunability and modulation bandwidth. Also, a variety
of complex modulation schemes may be implemented with
moderate efforts, as compared to electronic solutions. Fig. 7
shows two modulation approaches, modulation of both laser

signals as well as the single laser signal only [313]. A further
advantage is the ability to deliver an optical signal over a large
distance by means of an optical fiber. Thus, optical signal
generation and modulation may be performed separated from
the THz signal generation, which may yield flexibility to the
transmission system [23].
Another photonic method of generating THz signals is
through quantum cascade laser (QCL). Conventional lasers
emit photons through the recombination of electron-hole pairs
across the band gap. Thus, the lower bound for the frequency
of the emitted photons is defined by the band gap, which limits
the ability of the lasers to work below the IR band. In contrast,
QCLs are unipolar [315]. The photons are emitted by quantum
jumps of electrons between two different energy levels. These
energy levels are defined by the structure of the quantum wells.
This provides the possibility to tune the frequency of the laser.
Due to the low energy gap between the energy levels, QCLs
are well suited for mid-IR applications. In recent decades,
there was also a big progress on QCL development for the far-
IR or THz range [316]. QCLs are able to cover the frequency
band from 1 THz to 5 THz with a peak radiation power of 1 W
[317]–[319]. However, the operating frequency for QCL is in
the cryogenic range, which limits their applications.

### THz Transceiver: Antennas and Devices (Section VI excerpt)

VI. THZ TRANSCEIVER: ANTENNAS AND DEVICES
This section aims to provide readers with the necessary
knowledge required to design and build THz transceivers,
which is recognized as one of the most challenging issues to
block the practical use of THz communications and sensing.
We discuss the cutting-edge antenna technologies that are
appropriate for transmitting and receiving THz signals, along
with the fundamental and innovative aspects of photonic-
electronic devices and components used in constructing THz
transceivers.
A. THz Antennas
The conventional concepts of EM antennas can also be
applied in the THz regime, as mentioned in the references like
[249]. Nevertheless, the exceptionally high THz frequencies
raise specific limitations and issues that must be carefully
considered. The tiny wavelength necessitates the use of ex-
tremely small structures, imposing disruptive challenges in
the manufacturing processes. Fortunately, this reduction in
structure size opens up opportunities for the implementation
of innovative manufacturing techniques like low-temperature
co-fired ceramic (LTCC), antenna-on-chip design, substrate-
integrated waveguide (SIW), and others. Another major issue
is the skin effect in conductive materials [49]. This phe-
nomenon occurs as the skin depth, indicating the depth to
which current penetrates in a conductive material, decreases
significantly. As a result, the conductivity of metallic materials
decreases, leading to extra losses in the antenna system. To
address this challenge, researchers have been investigating the
utilization of novel materials, such as graphene. Graphene,
with its outstanding electrical and thermal properties, shows
great potential in alleviating the skin effect and enhancing the

22
performance of THz antennas. Its high electron mobility and
low resistivity render it an appealing choice for overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional conductive materials.
To provide readers with an insightful view, we present
the fundamentals of different THz antenna techniques and a
summary of current research advances in the following.
1) Horn Antennas: Horn antennas are widely used in wire-
less applications due to their favorable characteristics. They
belong to the category of high directivity antennas, capable of
achieving gains of up to 25 dBi. Similar to hollow waveguides,
these antennas have low power loss, making them appropri-
ate for low-noise and high-power applications. Furthermore,
they can operate across a wide frequency range, which is
advantageous for broadband signals. Various manufacturing
technologies have been considered to address the challenges
posed by the short wavelength of THz signals. Among these,
the authors of [250] introduced elective laser-melting 3D
printing technology to produce conical horn antennas, which
are capable of operating in the frequency bands of E (60 GHz
to 90 GHz), D (110 GHz to 170 GHz), and H (220 GHz to
325 GHz). Another appropriate manufacturing technology for
THz horn antennas is LTCC, as reported in [251]. By utilizing
substrate-integrated waveguide technology, a horn structure is
created within the multi-layer LTCC substrate. It achieves a
peak gain of 25 dBi and supports a bandwidth of 100 GHz.
Remarkably, the dimensions of the LTCC horn antenna are
compact, measuring only 5 × 5 × 2.8mm.
2) Planar Antennas: Planar transmission line technology,
commonly used for THz frequencies, offers flexible antenna
designs. Among these designs, patch antennas based on mi-
crostrip line technology are particularly well-known. However,
planar antennas generally exhibit inferior performance com-
pared to horn antennas. This is primarily due to the EM wave
partially propagating within a dielectric substrate, resulting
in increased overall loss. Additionally, the small thickness in
THz planar structures leads to substrate mode issues [252],
where some of the wave energy is trapped in the substrate
and cannot be effectively utilized. Despite these drawbacks,
planar antennas remain popular, primarily due to the flexibility
in producing the planar structures. The planar shapes can
be easily designed and realized [253]–[256]. Moreover, patch
antennas can be efficiently packaged to build an antenna array,
allowing flexible control on the antenna pattern [257]–[259].
Another advantage of THz planar antennas is the feasibility
of designing high-gain on-chip antennas [260], [261]. Sand-
wiched between the silicon and polycarbonate substrates, a
15-element array comprising circular and rectangular patches
on the top surface of the polycarbonate layer achieved a gain
of 11.71 dBi [262].
3) Substrate-Integrated Antennas: The small wavelength of
THz signals causes some challenges in the design of planar
antennas. However, it turns into an advantage by leveraging
the capability of low-cost manufacturing and the flexibility
of planar structures to build SIW. The key idea behind SIW
is to connect the upper and the lower conductive layers of a
substrate by the via walls, as discussed in a comprehensive
review of this technology in [263]. This process builds a
rectangular waveguide inside the substrate, with the distance
between vias defining the upper cutoff frequency. The SIW
technology can be integrated with a variety of antennas and
array designs, such as horn antennas [264], [265], slot antennas
[266], [267], patch antennas [268], [269], and others [270]–
[273].
4) Carbon-Based Antennas: Graphene and carbon nan-
otubes, which are rolled sheets of graphene, are two promising
materials for use over the THz frequency band. Due to the
skin effect, metallic materials, especially copper, suffer low
conductivity and therefore inferior performance. In contrast,
graphene features high conductivity due to the propagation of
plasmon mode in a high-frequency range. The conductivity can
be tuned not only by chemical doping, but also by applying
electric and magnetic fields, enabling the production of tunable
antennas [274]. These properties make graphene suitable for
fabricating THz antennas. The most discussed use is to replace
the metallic conductors with graphene or carbon nanotubes in,
for example, planar antenna structures [275], [276]. Besides,
the approach of building a dipole antenna based on carbon
nanotubes was reported [277], [278].
B. THz Components and Transceiver Design
For a long time, there has existed a terahertz gap [46]
between the microwave and infrared regions. The gap arises
because traditional electronics are not efficient at generating
or detecting THz signals, while optical techniques like lasers
and photonic detectors are generally not applicable due to
limitations related to the wavelengths involved. On the one
hand, these frequencies are too low for photonic devices. On
the other hand, they are too high for electronic devices. In
this regard, the THz band used to be unreachable for either
photonic or electronic technologies. Prior THz research was
concentrated on applications such as imaging or spectrometry
[39]. This fact is attributed to two major reasons:
• These applications require comparably high output power
but are not demanding on the receiver side, since the
amplitude rather than the phase of a signal acts as the
information carrier.
• The equipment or operational conditions are not so chal-
lenging, compared with small, lightweight, cheap, and
battery-powered mobile terminals. Some technologies, es-
pecially photonic generation and detection are applicable.
In contrast, THz communications and sensing require the
capability of accurate phase recovery, especially the case for
digital modulation when both in-phase and quadrature (IQ)
branches are exploited. Furthermore, compactness and low
energy consumption play critical roles. Thus, the utilization
of semiconductor-based integrated circuits is advantageous
for THz communications and sensing applications in 6G and
beyond systems. We present the fundamentals and state-of-the-
art advances in photonic and electronic components as follows.

Consequently, the number of multiplexer stages becomes a

ter and receiver front end in terms of different semiconductor
technologies. Among III-V semiconductor materials, InP com-
ponents demonstrate superior results in terms of output power
and noise figure. Furthermore, InP transistors can reach a max-
imum oscillating frequency fmax of up to 1.5 THz [293]. A
transceiver design based on a high-electron-mobility transistor
(HEMT) was reported. HEMT supports THz frequencies up
to 850 GHz, with particular attention given to the frequency
band around 300 GHz [280], [294], [295].

nication link that realizes a high throughput of 200 Gbps. Some
researchers present their transceiver design operating around
300 GHz [288], [290], [301]–[303]. A detailed survey on SiGe
transceiver for different purposes is provided in [304].

compared to other semiconductor technologies. CMOS field-
effect transistors (FETs) can only reach a maximum oscillating

CMOS transcivers operating in 300 GHz, which achieve high
data rates such as 105 Gbps or 32 Gbps. The highest reported
operating frequency is 390 GHz, reaching a data throughput
of 28 Gbps. Further achievements of CMOS transceiver are
summarized in [106], [311], [312].

frequency photonic radiation to a lower THz frequency, an

high tunability and modulation bandwidth. Also, a variety
of complex modulation schemes may be implemented with
moderate efforts, as compared to electronic solutions. Fig. 7

This provides the possibility to tune the frequency of the laser.
Due to the low energy gap between the energy levels, QCLs
are well suited for mid-IR applications. In recent decades,
there was also a big progress on QCL development for the far-
IR or THz range [316]. QCLs are able to cover the frequency
band from 1 THz to 5 THz with a peak radiation power of 1 W
[317]–[319]. However, the operating frequency for QCL is in
the cryogenic range, which limits their applications.

### Beamforming and Alignment (Section VII excerpt)

VII. BEAM-FORMING AND ALIGNMENT FOR THZ
COMMUNICATIONS AND SENSING
The use of the THz band can alleviate the problem of
spectrum scarcity and facilitate novel applications, such as
nano-scale networks and in-device communications. However,
its practical use is challenged by large propagation losses,
which generally lead to very short distances of signal trans-
mission [320]. The main causes of this problem include
the high spreading loss that grows quadratically with carrier
frequency, the gaseous absorption due to oxygen molecules
and water vapor in the atmosphere, and the adverse effects
of weather conditions, as discussed in the previous section.
Such a propagation loss can reach hundreds of decibels per
kilometer or even higher. Additionally, this problem is further
aggravated by the following two factors [174]:
• Strong thermal noise: Noise power is proportional to sig-
nal bandwidth with the constant power density. Therefore,
the unique advantage of massive bandwidth at the THz
band imposes a side effect of strong thermal noise.
• Hardware constraint: The transmit power at the THz band
is quite constrained since the output power decreases with
frequency and is at the level of decibel-milli-Watts in the
foreseeable future. Hence, raising power to extend the
communications distance is not feasible [102].
To extend the signal transmission distance beyond a few me-
ters, high-gain directional antennas are necessary to compen-
sate for such a high propagation loss in THz communications
and sensing. Thanks to tiny wavelengths, massive numbers of
elements can be tightly packed in a small area to generate
high beamforming gains [321]–[323]. In this section, we will
discuss the cutting-edge antenna forms, novel beamforming
techniques, and necessary beam alignment schemes at the THz
band [51].
A. Ultra-Massive MIMO
Since the length of a resonant antenna is typically in
the order of the wavelength at the resonance frequency, the
dimension of an array with tens of elements is a few square
meters and a few square centimeters at the sub-6G and

25
mmWave bands [104], respectively. Moving to the THz band,
the antenna length further reduces. Hundreds of elements can
be compacted in an array within a few centimeters using
conventional metallic materials. However, this number is not
sufficient to overcome the huge propagation loss suffered by
THz signals [320].
Taking advantage of surface plasmon polariton (SPP) waves
[324], the inter-element separation of an array can be further
reduced to the SPP wavelength, which is much smaller than
the EM wavelength. Consequently, nanomaterials that sup-
port the propagation of SPP waves, such as graphene and
metamaterials, are employed to further improve the hardware
compactness. Graphene, a one-atom-thick carbon nanomaterial
with unprecedented mechanical, electrical, and optical prop-
erties, is employed to fabricate plasmonic nano-antennas with
a smaller size of almost two orders of magnitude compared
to metallic THz antennas [105]. In particular, thousands of
graphene-based nano-antennas can be embedded in a few
square millimeters at 1 THz. The emergence of nano-antennas
paves the way for building very large-scale arrays for THz
communications. In 2016, Akyildiz and Jornet [325] presented
the concept of UMMIMO communications, and demonstrated
a 1024 × 1024 system where both the transmitter and receiver
are equipped with an array of 1024 nano-antennas.
A massive number of elements impose challenges such as
prohibitive power consumption and high hardware complexity
[326]. It is worth rethinking the array architecture and beam-
forming schemes in UMMIMO systems at the THz band. Fully
digital beamforming can generate a desired beam but it leads
to unaffordable energy consumption and hardware cost since
each antenna in a large-scale array needs its dedicated RF
chain. This motivates the study of analog beamforming with
low complexity. By employing analog phase shifters, only a
single RF chain is needed, substantially lowering hardware
and power costs. Nevertheless, the analog architecture supports
only a single stream, limiting data rates and the number of
users. As a compromise of these two forms, hybrid digital-
analog architecture is the best choice for THz from the
perspective of performance and complexity trade-off. Combin-
ing an analog-shifter network with a few RF chains, hybrid
beamforming can significantly reduce hardware cost and low
energy consumption, while achieving comparable performance
as digital beamforming.
Although hybrid beamforming has been extensively stud-
ied for the sub-6GHz and mmWave bands [327]–[329], the
peculiarities of the THz band, such as channel sparsity [118]
and beam squint [330], impose many difficulties for designing
an UMMIMO system. Currently, many new forms of hybrid
beamforming are discussed in the literature, including array
of subarrays (AoSA) to balance the power consumption and
data rate, widely-spaced multi-subarray to overcome the low
spatial multiplexing gain due to channel sparsity, and true-
time-delay-based hybrid beamforming to address the problem
of beam squint [331].
1) Array of Subarrays: In a hybrid architecture, the con-
nection between elements and RF chains has two basic forms:
fully-connected (FC) and AoSA [332]. In the FC hybrid
beamforming, each element is fully connected to all RF chains
via a signal combiner, and the signal of an RF chain radiates
over all antenna elements via an individual group of phase
shifters. Any RF chain should have the capability to drive the
entire large-scale antenna array, which is power-aggressive.
Particularly, the use of a large number of phase shifters and
combiners will exacerbate the problems of high hardware cost
and power consumption. In contrast, all elements in AoSA are
divided into disjoint subsets called subarrays, and a subarray
is only accessible to one specific RF chain [333]. AoSA
conducts signal processing at a subarray level with fewer phase
shifters, such that hardware cost, power consumption, and
signal power loss can be dramatically reduced. In addition,
beamforming and spatial multiplexing can be jointly optimized
by cooperating with precoding in the baseband.
Recent literature shows the strong interest to exploit an
array of subarrays. For instance, Lin and Li published a
series of works on this topic. In [334], they analyzed the
ergodic capacity of an indoor single-user THz communications
system and obtained an upper bound, providing guidance on
the design of antenna subarray size and numbers for certain
long-term data rate requirements with different distances. An
adaptive beamforming scheme, which considers the impact of
transmission distance, was proposed for multi-user THz com-
munications in [335]. Therein the array-of-subarray structure
for multi-user sub-THz communications was considered and
its spectral and energy efficiency were analyzed. They then
showcased a THz-based multi-user system for indoor usage
that uses an array-of-subarrays architecture to handle hardware
restrictions and channel characteristics in the THz band, which
has shown a great advantage by comparing with the FC
structure in both spectral and energy efficiency [332]. In [336],
Tarboush et al. proposed an accurate stochastic simulator
of statistical THz channels, named TeraMIMO, aiming at
catalyzing the research of UMMIMO antenna configurations.
TeraMIMO adopted the AoSA antenna structure for hybrid
beamforming and accounted for spatial sparsity.
To further reduce the complexity, various alternating opti-
mization algorithms have been proposed for the AoSA archi-
tectures [333]. In contrast to the FC architecture, the AoSA
architecture has a restricted number of phase shifters that
equals the number of antennas. However, since the RF chains
and antennas are connected exhaustively, the FC architecture
can achieve data rates comparable to those of the optimal
fully-digital beamforming architecture. Conversely, the data
rate of the AoSA architecture is significantly lower compared
to that of the FC architecture. This is attributed to the partial
interconnection between antennas and RF chains. Hence, we
need to balance the power consumption and data rate of the
THz hybrid beamforming, inspired by the challenge of design-
ing large-scale antenna arrays in THz UMMIMO systems. To
address this issue, some researchers introduced a new form
of hybrid beamforming called dynamic array-of-subarrays
(DAoSA) [337]–[339], which features a flexible hardware
connection. DAoSA achieves a good balance between power
consumption and data rates by intelligently determining the
connection between sub-arrays and RF chains.
2) Widely-Spaced Multi-Subarray: Due to the tiny wave-
length, the THz channel is usually sparse, consisting of a

26
LoS path and a few reflection paths. The transmit power
concentrates on the LoS path, and the overall angular spread
of THz signals is small. For instance, a maximal angular
spread of 40° has been observed for indoor environments
in the THz band, compared to 120° for indoor scenarios
at 60 GHz mmWave frequencies [340]. Since the number of
spatial degrees of freedom is upper-bounded by the number
of multipath components, the number of data streams or the
potential spatial multiplexing gain is usually small, limiting the
achievable bandwidth efficiency at the THz band. A widely-
spaced multi-subarray hybrid beamforming architecture is
proposed [341] to overcome the low spatial multiplexing gain
due to channel sparsity. Instead of critical spacing, the inter-
subarray separation is over hundreds of wavelengths, reducing
the correlation between the subarrays.
The widely-spaced multi-subarray (WSMS) hybrid beam-
forming architecture is promising by exploiting intra-path
multiplexing for THz UMMIMO systems [342]. It was dis-
covered in [343] that when the distance between antennas is
expanded, the planar-wave assumption becomes invalid, and
it is necessary to consider the propagation of spherical waves
between antennas. Previous research has examined the use
of intra-path multiplexing in LoS MIMO architecture oper-
ating at microwave and mmWave frequencies, which enables
multiplexing gain to be achieved using just a single LoS
path [344]. Given that the intra-path multiplexing gain is not
restricted by the number of multipath, it is a highly viable
and promising solution for THz communications, which are
known to exhibit significant channel sparsity [345]. In [346],
the authors demonstrated that the WSMS architecture can
substantially improve the spectral efficiency of THz systems
through the use of additional intra-path multiplexing gain,
which sets it apart from existing hybrid beamforming that
solely relies on inter-path multiplexing. As the follow-up,
the authors designed an alternating optimization algorithm to
maximize the sum rate [347] under the WSMS architecture.
3) True-Time-Delay-Based Hybrid Beamforming: Most of
the current hybrid beamforming architectures rely on phase
shifters, which are frequency-independent, inducing the same
phase rotation at different frequency components of a signal.
Under the ultra-wide bandwidth at the THz, these shifters
only provide correct phase shifting for a certain frequency,
whereas other frequencies suffer from phase misalignment.
As a result, the formed beam is squinted with a substantial
power loss, e.g., 5 dB reported in [331]. To solve the problem
of beam squint at the THz band, true-time-delay (TTD) can
be applied to substitute phase shifters [330]. The TTD is
frequency-dependent, and the phase rotation adjusted by TTD
is proportional to the carrier frequency and perfectly matches
the ultra-wideband THz beamforming.
According to [348], the TTD-based phase shifting is aligned
with the requirements of wideband THz hybrid beamforming,
given its proportional relationship with the carrier frequency.
While ideal TTDs with infinite or high resolution are capable
of precise phase adjustments, they are often associated with
high power consumption and hardware complexity [349].
For the perspective of practical THz systems, low-resolution
TTDs that strike a balance between energy efficiency and
performance are more suitable, as reported in the literature
such as [349]–[351]. In [352], a novel hybrid precoding archi-
tecture named delay-phase precoding (DPP) was introduced
to mitigate the issue of beam squint in THz communications
systems. By incorporating a time delay network between digi-
tal and analog precoding, DPP generates frequency-dependent
beamforming vectors. Similarly, Gao et al. [353] proposed a
TTD-based hybrid beamforming that aims to address beam
squint through virtual subarrays, as first presented in [354].
The proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance as
that of full-digital precoding.
In order to address the limitation of TTD, Nguyen and
Kim [355] proposed a hybrid beamforming scheme that
takes into account the relationship between the number of
antennas and the required delay for TTD. They also car-
ried out joint optimization under limited delay to create an
optimal compensation scheme for beam squint. It is noted
that most research work, as mentioned above, focused on 2D
hybrid beamforming, which is primarily designed for uniform
linear array (ULA). However, ULAs may not be suitable
for UMMIMO systems due to limited antenna aperture. In
contrast, uniform planar arrays (UPAs) that can accommodate
a large number of elements compactly, are more potential for
deploying UMMIMO systems. There is a lack of research on
beam squint compensation in 3D hybrid beamforming using
ULAs for THz broadband UMMIMO systems. Responding
to this, the authors of [330] proposed a 3D beamforming
architecture by leveraging two-tier TTD, which is able to
combat the beam squint effect from both the horizontal and
vertical directions. The impact of the array structure on the
beam squint has been analyzed in [356].
B. Lens Antenna Array
Despite its high potential at the THz band, hybrid beam-
forming is still confined by high hardware and power costs
due to the use of many analog phase shifters. Some studies
[357] demonstrate that the power consumed by phase shifters
becomes critical. In this context, a disruptive antenna tech-
nology called lens antenna [358] has been studied in recent
years.
James Clerk Maxwell predicted the existence of EM waves
in 1873 and inferred that visible light is one type of EM waves.
To verify Maxwell’s theory, early scientists who believed a
radio wave is a form of invisible light, concentrated on du-
plicating classic optics experiments into radio. Heinrich Hertz
proved the existence of EM waves and also first demonstrated
the refraction phenomena of radio waves at 450 MHz using a
prism. These experiments revealed the possibility of focusing
radio waves on a narrow beam as visible lights through an
optical lens. In 1894, Oliver Lodge [359] successfully used
an optical lens to concentrate 4 GHz radio waves. In the same
year, Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose [360] built a
cylindrical sulfur lens to generate a beam in his microwave
experiments over 6 GHz to 60 GHz. In 1894, Augusto Righi at
the University of Bologna focused radio waves at 12 GHz with
32 cm lenses. In World War II, the race of developing radar
technology fostered the emergence of modern lens antennas.

27
Used as a radar reflector, the famous Luneberg lens [361] was
invented in 1946, which is also attached to stealth fighters
nowadays to make it detectable during training or to conceal
their true EM signature.
As refracting visible light by an optical lens, a lens antenna
uses a shaped piece of radio-transparent material to bend and
concentrate EM waves [362]. It usually comprises an emitter
radiating radio waves and a piece of dielectric or composite
material in front of the emitter as a converging lens to force
the radio waves into a narrow beam. Conversely, the lens
directs the incoming radio waves into the feeder in a receive
antenna, converting the induced electromagnetic waves into
electric currents. To generate narrow beams, the lens needs to
be much larger than the wavelength of the EM wave [363].
Hence, a lens antenna is more suitable for mmWave and THz
communications, with tiny wavelengths. Like an optical lens,
radio waves have a different speed within the lens material
than in free space so the varying lens thickness delays the
waves passing through it by different amounts, changing the
shape of the wavefront and the direction of the waves.
On top of lens antennas, an advanced antenna structure
referred to as a lens antenna array has been developed [364]. A
lens antenna array usually consists of two major components:
an EM lens and an array with antenna elements positioned in
the focal region of the lens. EM lenses can be implemented
in different ways, e.g., dielectric materials, transmission lines
with variable lengths, and periodic inductive and capacitive
structures. Despite its various implementation, the purpose of
EM lenses is to provide variable phase shifting for electro-
magnetic waves at different angles [365]. In other words, a
lens antenna array can direct the signals emitted from different
transmit antennas to different beams with sufficiently separated
angles of departure. Conversely, a lens antenna array at the
receiver can concentrate the incident signals from sufficiently
separated directions to different receive antennas [366].
Recent research work reported a few high-gain THz lens
antennas, such as dielectric or metallic lens antennas [367]–
[369]. Dielectric lens antennas have been demonstrated with
high gain and wide operating bandwidth by integrating the
dielectric lens with a standard rectangular waveguide feed
[367] or a leaky-wave feed [368]. But their radiation efficiency
needs to be improved. On the other hand, metallic lens
antennas have no dielectric loss, making them suitable for
THz communications and sensing. In [369], a high-gain THz
antenna using a metallic lens composed of metallic waveguide
delay lines was reported. For wideband signal transmission,
recently, the authors of [370] presented a fully metallic lens
antenna with a wide impedance bandwidth and high gain at
the D band from 110 GHz to 170 GHz. A flared H-plane horn
is used to achieve a large H-plane radiation aperture to further
increase the radiation gain.
The deployment of MMIMO systems entails the challenges
associated with a huge amount of antenna elements [371].
EM lens arrays with a reasonable number of elements can
lower the required number of antennas and corresponding RF
chains while maintaining high beamforming gain. However,
dielectric EM lenses are difficult to integrate with multiple
antenna techniques due to their bulky size, high insertion
loss, and long focal lengths to control the beam gain. The
metallic lens antennas are defined as artificial composites that
obtain electrical properties from their structure rather than their
constituent materials. Some studies on metallic lens antennae
have been done to achieve beam gain from a single antenna,
like [372]. Lee et al. proposed a large-aperture metallic lens
antenna designed for multi-layer MIMO transmission for 6G,
demonstrating that a single large-aperture metallic lens antenna
can achieve a beam gain of up to 14 dB compared to the
case without a lens. By adopting the proposed large-aperture
metallic lens antenna, system-level simulations show that the
data throughput of the user equipment is effectively increased
[373].
C. Beam Alignment: Training of Beams
The utilization of the promising THz spectrum range is
hindered by significant propagation losses imposed on its
frequencies. To counteract the losses, large antenna arrays,
such as UMMIMO and lens antenna array discussed above,
can be employed, but this leads to highly directional and
narrow beams [374]. To ensure a satisfactory signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at the receiver and prevent connection loss, it
is critical to maintaining degree-level alignment between the
transmitter and receiver beams. Therefore, beam alignment
is a critical issue that must be addressed for establishing
a reliable connection. This is accomplished by aligning the
beams at the transmitter and receiver to the direction of
the channel paths, where channel state information (CSI) is
critical for implementing the fine alignment [375]. However,
traditional channel sensing methods used at lower frequencies
are not feasible at THz frequencies due to the significant path
losses that render pilot signals undetectable during the link
establishment stage.
Significant research efforts have been made in recent years
to understand the unique characteristics of the THz chan-
nel and to develop appropriate beam alignment algorithms.
These efforts aim to establish beam alignment during the link
establishment stage [376], [377] and to maintain alignment
while the beams are in motion (beam tracking). Two cat-
egories of beam alignment techniques have been identified:
beam training [378] and beam estimation [379], as shown in
Fig. 8. The former involves transmitting known signals and
adjusting beamforming parameters to align the beams. The
latter involves estimating CSI from received signals and using
it to refine the beamforming parameters. This part surveys the
state-of-the-art advances in beam tracking techniques, while
beam estimation is discussed in the subsequent part.
Beam training involves scanning the channel with direc-
tional beams from a codebook to determine the beam pair at
the transmitter and receiver that results in the highest SNR
of the received signal [380]. Beam training can be broadly
classified into two categories: exhaustive and hierarchical
training, which are discussed as follows:
1) Exhaustive Training: Many studies have adopted ex-
haustive training, which involves sequentially probing all the
predefined directions in the codebook to find the optimal
beam pair that maximizes the SNR at the receiver [381].

Fig. 8. Illustration of beam alignment techniques.
The approach is used in the IEEE 802.15.3c standard [382].
However, the method is time-consuming and not practical at
THz frequencies, where beams from a large-scale antenna
array tend to be very narrow, making it difficult to scan the
entire space in a reasonable amount of time. Additionally,
the accuracy of the training is limited by the codebook’s
resolution.
Responding to these limitations, Tan and Dai [383] have
improved the exhaustive search by exploiting the beam split
or squint effect. They used delay-phase-precoding architecture
to control the beam split effect and accelerate the tracking
process [384]. By doing so, the split beams have wider
angular coverage and can scan many directions in a single
shot. Another approach from the RF domain used leaky-wave
antennas (LWA) at the transmitter and receiver of a THz link
to estimate the angle-of-departure (AoD) and angle-of-arrival
(AoA) [385]. The angular radiation of an LWA is frequency-
dependent, and the received spectral peak determines the AoD.
The bandwidth of the received signal is proportional to the
rotation angle over the AoA of the LWA receiver, which
speeds up the channel scanning process but requires additional
hardware at both the transmitter and receiver.
2) Hierarchical Training: From a practical point of view,
many studies have adopted hierarchical training to reduce
training overhead [348], [378], [381], [386], [387]. Hierar-
chical algorithms are based on multi-resolution codebooks,
which contain wide beams at lower levels and narrow beams
at higher levels. The search begins at the lowest level and
gradually moves to higher levels to find the optimal narrow
beam. In [348], the authors proposed a subarray-based multi-
resolution codebook, where beams at each level are generated
by the contribution of all subarrays. In [387], the authors
proposed an accelerated hierarchical training that concurrently
scans angular space with different RF chains. The authors of
[388] proposed a multi-modal beam pattern-based training that
simultaneously radiates beams targeting at different directions
using a single RF chain. The equally spaced activation ap-
proach has been proposed to generate the steering vector for
multiple beam radiation. However, the loss at THz frequencies
may render the training algorithm ineffective. The authors
in [375] and [389] adopted hierarchical training that utilizes
the power-angular spectral correlation between sub-6GHz and
THz frequencies.
In [390], Stratidakis et al. proposed a localization-aided
hierarchical beam tracking algorithm that uses location infor-
mation to reduce pilot overhead. This algorithm assumes the
linear motion of a user, which may not be accurate in realistic
scenarios. In [391], the authors proposed a unified 3D training
and tracking framework based on a 3D hierarchical codebook
built upon the quadruple-uniform-planar-array architecture.
This proposal offers two advantages: a unified framework for
training and tracking and 3D space coverage compared to 2D
space coverage in most existing works. The training overhead
of hierarchical algorithms is much lower compared to ex-
haustive ones. However, hierarchical algorithms suffer from a
high overhead of feedback messages required for coordination
between the transmitter and receiver. The number of levels
in multi-resolution codebooks also leads to higher training
overhead, which may not enhance performance, especially in
multi-hop THz links [392]. A new approach is proposed in
[393], where it is based on a multi-armed bandit algorithm
and utilizes prior knowledge of channel frequency-selective
fading. This algorithm is designed with a hierarchical structure
to accelerate the beam alignment process.
D. Beam Alignment: Estimating of Beams
Beam estimation is a method of acquiring channel infor-
mation with the goal of reducing training overhead when
compared to beam scanning techniques. The estimation pro-
cess begins with initial training, which involves collecting
channel measurement. These measurement are then processed
to derive the angular information of the target channel. Prior
studies have proposed a variety of algorithms, based on linear
estimation [394], [395], compressive sensing (ComS)-based
sparse estimation [396]–[400], beamspace-based estimation
[401], [402], subspace-based estimation [379], [403]–[405],
or deep learning-based estimation [379], [406], [407].
1) Linear Estimation: The authors of [394] used an ex-
tended Kalman filter, which is a well-known example of
linear estimation, to perform beam tracking for a mobile
station (MS). The MS sends training symbols over the uplink
during each time slot, and the extended Kalman filter-based
algorithm at the base station (BS) iteratively estimates the
channel parameters (the path gain, AoD, and AoA) from
the observed signal. The proposed algorithm achieves milli-
degree level angle estimation with moderate mobility of the
MS and antenna array size. However, the study assumes the
BS is equipped with a fully digital beamformer, which is not
practical due to the high power consumption imposed by a
large number of RF chains. Additionally, the study assumes
that the MS is parallel to the BS during tracking, such that
AoD equals AoA, which is not realistic because the orientation
of the MS can be arbitrary in real-world scenarios. Other linear
methods, such as maximum likelihood and least squares, can
also be applied [395]. However, these estimators require a

29
large number of observations and do not exploit the sparsity
feature of THz channels.
2) Compress Sensing-based Sparse Estimation: The spar-
sity property of THz channels can significantly reduce the
computational complexity of beam estimation algorithms by
transforming the problem into a sparse recovery problem. A
technique referred to as ComS is considered an optimal ap-
proach to solving these problems, as discussed by the authors
in [399]. They analyzed two ComS-based algorithms, i.e.,
greedy compressive sampling matching and Dantzig selector-
based method, for solving convex programs. The results show
that the ComS-based methods have higher accuracy compared
to linear estimation based on least squares. The authors
in [396] utilized ComS-based techniques to accelerate the
training proposed in [375]. In this approach, the estimated
angles from wide beams in the first stage are refined using an
L1-norm regularized least squares method to obtain accurate
estimates of AoD and AoA, reducing the scope of the narrow
beam search in the second stage.
Yang et al. [400] proposed an orthogonal matching pursuit-
based fast algorithm to estimate the AoA and AoD of a BS-
MS link. This study considered the cost and power consump-
tion of adopting an auxiliary fully-digital array for channel
estimation and evaluated the effect of RF imperfections and
low-resolution analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) per RF
chain. The study adopts the virtual channel model, which
assumes that the AoA and AoD are discretely distributed over
a spatial grid utilizing the angular sparsity of the THz channel,
making it a sparse recovery problem suitable for ComS-based
algorithms. However, this discrete grid assumption reduces the
estimation accuracy due to the grid resolution. To mitigate this
limitation, the authors in [408] proposed an iterative reweight-
based super-resolution estimation scheme, which optimizes the
on-grid estimation iteratively to converge to neighboring off-
grid angles. Simulation results show that the off-grid solution
has an improved accuracy and spectral efficiency compared
to on-grid solutions. Similarly, the authors in [409] proposed
a gridless ComS-based algorithm to estimate the AoA for
arbitrary 3D antenna arrays, eliminating the quantization error
of the grid assumption.
The mentioned ComS-based estimators are generally built
on the assumption of angular sparsity of THz channels, which
holds in the far field but is not valid in the near field. Therefore,
the work in [397] considers ComS-based estimation in the near
field where the angular sparsity assumption does not hold. The
results show that the channel in the near field exhibits polar
sparsity rather than angular sparsity, which was exploited by a
ComS-based polar-domain simultaneous orthogonal matching
pursuit algorithm.
3) Beamspace-based Estimation: As we know, the MIMO
beamspace channel can be realized through the use of a
discrete lens array (DLA). Such arrays function as passive
phase shifters that steer beams towards specific directions
based on the incident point to the lens aperture [410]. The
number of these directions is limited by the number of antenna
elements, resulting in a beam-sparse channel. This artificially
created sparsity reduces the pilot overhead required for channel
estimation compared to conventional methods. In [401], the
authors adopted the DLA-based MIMO system architecture to
create the MIMO beamspace channel and utilized its sparsity
for fast channel tracking. A priori information-aided tracking
scheme was proposed for MIMO beamspace systems, where
the channel was conventionally estimated in the first three
time slots and the physical direction of the MS was then
derived based on a temporal variation law. The estimated
physical direction was used to determine the support of the
beamspace channel, which corresponds to the dominant beam
directions. However, the estimation accuracy depends strongly
on the localization accuracy. In [402], the authors extended
the work in [401] and proposed a cooperative localization-
aided tracking algorithm with multiple BSs, each equipped
with a DLA. These BSs cooperate to accurately localize the
MS for improved channel tracking. While beamspace MIMO
solutions significantly reduce the overhead in comparison with
that of conventional estimation methods, their accuracy may
be limited by the discrete directions generated by the DLA
and restricted numbers of beams.
4) Subspace-based Estimation: When estimating contin-
uously distributed AoA and AoD, another way referred to
as subspace-based algorithms can be performed, with the
aim of avoiding the estimation error caused by the sparse
solutions or beam sparsity in beamspace solutions. In general,
these algorithms collect channel measurement and identify
the eigenvectors that correspond to the signal subspace. Two
widely known algorithms, i.e., MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Clas-
sification) and ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via
Rotational Invariance Technique), belong to subspace-based
estimation [379], [403].
In [379], the authors adopted the MUSIC algorithm to
achieve millidegree-level AoA estimation. This study utilized
a hybrid AoSA architecture and collected measurement data
by probing random steering vectors. The covariance matrix of
the measurement data was then calculated and decomposed
into signal and noise subspaces. The AoA was estimated by
searching the MUSIC pseudospectrum function for vectors or-
thogonal to the noise eigenvectors. The estimation was further
refined by collecting new measurement based on the coarse
estimated angles. In [403], the ESPRIT algorithm was adopted
for super-resolution channel estimation, which involved multi-
ple steps such as spatial smoothing, forward-backward averag-
ing techniques [411], singular value decomposition (SVD), and
joint diagonalization. While subspace solutions show improved
performance compared to sparse solutions, their computational
complexity is significantly higher.
5) Deep Learning-based Estimation: Recently, deep learn-
ing (DL)-based techniques have emerged as a promising alter-
native to replace conventional estimators. DL-based solutions
are particularly effective for complex multi-user scenarios
where the input and output of the channel are not directly
related. In [379], a branch of DL referred to as deep convo-
lutional neural network (DCNN) is used to estimate the AoA
of a multipath channel. The measurement matrix is collected
through random beamforming and combining matrices at
the transmitter and receiver, respectively. The measured data
is fed into the neural network. Three convolutional layers
extract the spatial peculiarities of the channel, and two fully-

30
connected layers capture the non-linear relationship between
these peculiarities and AoA estimation. The results show
higher estimation accuracy compared to that of the subspace-
based MUSIC algorithm at high SNR.
In [406], a DCNN architecture is used to estimate the near-
field channel under the spherical wave propagation model.
The proposed DCNN-based approach addresses the spherical
wave propagation model by considering the inter-subarray
phase error as an output parameter of the network. In [407],
deep kernel learning (DKL) combined with Gaussian process
regression (GPR) is used to estimate the indoor THz channel
in a multi-user scenario. In particular, a deep neural network
(DNN) is trained to capture the non-linear relationship be-
tween the input and output of the channel. The results show
that this DNN-based solution outperformed the minimum-
mean square error (MMSE) and least squares-based linear
estimators.
Prior studies have demonstrated the superiority of DL-based
solutions over the conventional solutions in complex scenarios.
It also revealed that DL networks need lots of computational
and storage resources, intensive offline training, and validation.
Moreover, their efficiency in low SNR scenarios requires
further investigation. In order to achieve fast initial access
in wireless networks, a DNN framework called DeepAI has
been proposed, which maps the received signal strength (RSS)
to identify the optimal beam direction [412]. The authors
have introduced a sequential feature selection (SFS) algorithm
that selects efficient and reliable beam pairs for DeepAI’s
inputs in LoS mmWave channels. However, the SFS algorithm
fails to improve the accuracy and performance of DeepAI
in NLoS scenarios. The simulation results show that DeepAI
outperforms the conventional beam-sweeping method. Another
DL-based beam selection algorithm is suitable for 5G NR has
been proposed by the authors in [413].

VIII. THZ SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS TOWARD 6G AND
BEYOND
The ongoing research and development of the 6G system is
set to revolutionize the way that various domains and layers of
a mobile network interact and communicate with each other
and with authorized third parties [414], [415]. As we stated
numerous times throughout this paper, one of the key enablers
of 6G is THz communications and sensing, which promise
to deliver ultra-high data rates, ultra-low-latency connectiv-
ity, high-resolution sensing, and high-accuracy positioning in
the coming decades. Nevertheless, the full potential of THz
communications and sensing can only be realized through its
integration with other emerging technologies.
This section explores THz networks from a systematic point
of view, with an emphasis on the synergy of THz communi-
cations and sensing with a variance of potential 6G technolo-
gies, including massive multi-input multi-output, ultra-massive
multi-input multi-output, non-orthogonal multiple access, re-
configurable intelligent surfaces, non-terrestrial networks, digi-
tal twins, artificial intelligencem machine learning. Moreover,
we discuss security, localization, joint communications and
sensing, multi-connectivity, and channel awareness for THz
systems and networks. By examining these synergies, we hope
to shed light on the most significant research challenges and
opportunities facing the development and deployment of THz
communications and sensing in 6G and beyond networks,
as well as the potential benefits for future applications and
services.
A. THz-MMIMO Systems and Networks
Compared to lower frequencies at sub-6 GHz and mmWave,
the THz bands have a much smaller signal wavelength, which
leads to a tiny size of antenna (i.e. a larger number of antennas
within the same surface area) and narrower beams. Both the
factors are beneficial for MMIMO and grant a great potential
in the THz band than at lower frequencies. For example,
Akyildiz and Jornet demonstrated that an UMMIMO system
operating in 1 THz with the dimension of 1024 × 1024 is
realized by the arrays that have a size of only 1 mm2 [320].
However, the application of MMIMO and/or UMMIMO in
practical 6G THz communications and sensing are challenged
in various aspects. In addition to the barriers in the fabrication
of nano-antenna arrays, the complexity and sparsity of THz
channels are also limiting the exploitation of MMIMO in this
band. Accurate channel models, physical (PHY) layer enabling
technologies, as well as novel link layer design, are needed to
release the full potential of THz MMIMO.
A lot of works in modeling THz MMIMO channels have
been reported since the late 2010s, overwhelmingly with the
ray-tracing methodology. Han et al. proposed in [416] a model
for UMMIMO channels over a distance to 20 m and in the
frequency windows of 0.3 THz to 0.4 THz and 0.9 THz to
1 THz. Busari et al. studied the 0.1 THz MMIMO channel in
[417] a specific outdoor street-side scenario, investigating the
impacts of precoding scheme, carrier frequency, bandwidth,
and antenna gain on the system regarding spectral and energy
efficiencies. Sheikh et al. focused on the critical features of
rough surface reflection and diffuse scattering at THz frequen-
cies, and proposed in [212] a 3D indoor model for 0.3 THz and
0.35 THz MMIMO channels with different surface roughness
levels, considering both LoS and NLoS scenarios. In the recent
work [336], Tarboush et al. reported their channel model for
wideband UMMIMO THz communications and a simulator
based thereon.
Efforts on the physical layer deal with the problem of
beamforming and combining from the perspectives of beam
training and beam tracking, i.e., finding the best beam pattern
and online adjusting it, in order to obtain the best link quality
and maintain it against the time variation of the channel. As
outlined by Ning et al. in their tutorial [51], there are two
basic principles of beamforming: the precoding/decoding that
is executed in the digital domain, and the beam steering that
works in the analog domain. Each of the principles, as well
as their hybrid, when applied in the wideband THz systems,
must be carefully designed to address two main issues: the
spatial-wideband effect that different antennas receive different
symbols at the same time, and the frequency-wideband effect
that the beam pattern of a phase array codeword changes with
the frequency of the signal (a.k.a. the beam squint or beam

31
split). While most existing methods leverage either the digital
precoding approach [352], [418], or the precoding/steering
hybrid [353], [401], [419], [420], new research interests in
the steering approach based on RIS are arising [421], [422].
Whilst higher layer design has not been a major research focus
of MMIMO THz systems so far, there is pioneering work on
multi-access scheme reported in [207].
B. THz-NOMA Systems and Networks
Another promising radio access network (RAN) technology
for enabling THz-MIMO systems and networks is NOMA,
which allows allocating of the same radio resources to more
than one user simultaneously and invokes the so-called succes-
sive interference cancellation (SIC) approach on the receiver
side to decode the information for different users successively
[423]. Compared to lower frequencies, the low-rank channels
in the THz bands can be much more correlated because of
the limited-scattering transmission, which reduces the channel
orthogonality between different users and makes NOMA a
promising technique to improve the spectral efficiency [26].
Serghiou et al. [58] believe that in LoS scenarios where spatial
processing approaches fail to separate the users from each
other, a combination of NOMA with UMMIMO can provide
more fair user access in terms of resource allocation, and there-
with achieve better spectral efficiency of the overall network.
Meanwhile, with proper resource allocation algorithm, NOMA
can also enhance the energy efficiency in THz communications
and sensing systems [424].
To evaluate the feasibility of MIMO-NOMA systems in THz
bands, Sabuj et al. proposed in [425] a finite blocklength
(FBL) channel model and therewith evaluated the system
performance regarding critical machine-type communications
(CMTC) scenarios. In contrast to its good performance in LoS
scenarios, THz-NOMA performs much more poorly when the
connected devices are blocked by obstacles [426]. To address
this issue, RIS appears as a promising solution. In [427],
Xu et al. proposed a smart RIS framework for THz-NOMA,
which delivers significant enhancements in the system energy
efficiency and the reliability of super-fast-experience users.
The principle of NOMA requires users to be paired/clustered
for sharing radio resources, and relies on an appropriate clus-
tering to achieve satisfactory system performance. Shahjala et
al. comparatively reviewed the user clustering techniques for
MMIMO-NOMA THz systems in [428], and proposed a fuzzy
C-means-based clustering approach in [429].
It should be noted that many popular clustering policies are
tending to pair a user with good channel, called cell center
user (CCU), to another with poor channel, called cell edge user
(CEU). Such policies lead to a gain in the spectral efficiency
of the overall system, but a degradation at the CEU due to
power splitting. To address this issue, Ding et al. proposed in
[430] a cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (CNOMA)
scheme where the CCU always forwards the message for CEU
that it obtains during the SIC, so that the performance loss at
CEU is compensated. However, this design is forcing the CCU
to work as a relay which drains its battery. Therefore, simul-
taneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is
often introduced into CNOMA systems so that the CCU is
able to harvest energy from the radio signal to support the
relaying [431]. At THz frequencies, due to the high spreading
loss and atmospheric absorption, the power propagation loss is
more critical than that at lower frequencies, and the SWIPT-
assisted CNOMA solution can be more important. Oleiwi
and Al-Raweshidy analyzed the performance of SWIPT THz-
NOMA in [432], and correspondingly designed a channel-
aware pairing mechanism [432].
C. THz-RIS Systems and Networks
The 6G and beyond systems will be revolutionized by the
tremendous potential of RIS [433]–[435] and THz [436], the
two cutting-edge enablers for the access domain of a futuristic
communications and sensing network. The synergy between
RIS and THz lies in the fact that RIS can be utilized to improve
the performance of THz systems by providing a cost-effective
solution to the propagation challenges associated with THz
frequencies [110]. By utilizing the reconfigurability and ver-
satility features of RIS, it is possible to address the challenges
of THz wave propagation, especially the use of bypassing the
blockage of THz beams [437], thereby improving the overall
performance of THz communications and sensing.
By controlling the phase, amplitude, and polarization, RIS
can effectively steer, reflect, and amplify electromagnetic
waves in THz systems and networks. Consequently, it enables
a vast array of applications and use-case scenarios, including
beamforming, wireless power transfer, and indoor localization,
among others. In addition, by employing RIS-assisted spatial
modulation, the THz-RIS systems and networks have the
potential to dramatically improve their spectral efficiency.
More importantly, RIS can be used to generate virtual channels
that compensate for the propagation losses of THz waves so
that SNR and the coverage area of THz communications and
sensing could be increased. By far, the intersection of the RIS
and THz has been intensively studied in the literature. There
exist a number of overview and survey papers that provide
an insight into such synergies, including [53], [438]–[440].
In addition to the aforementioned surveys, we discovered
during our research that the intersection between these two
technologies has been dramatic, including in the context of
massive MIMO, millimeter wave, 3D beamforming, satellite
networks, and many others. Moreover, a large number and
various types of physical layer-related optimization problems
have been jointly investigated.
D. THz-Aided Non-Terrestrial Networks
With its ambition of ubiquitous 3D coverage, 6G and
beyond are envisioned to include different non-terrestrial in-
frastructures, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), high-
altitude platform (HAP), LEO satellites, and geostationary
Earth orbit (GEO) satellites, as an indispensable part of its
architecture. Since the air/space channels and air/space-to-
ground channels are less subject to blockages w.r.t. terrestrial
channels, the LoS link availability is much higher, implying
a vast potential for THz communications and sensing [441].
On the one hand, the tremendous amount of spectral resources

32
offers the feasibility of efficient interconnection among these
terrestrial, air, and space platforms through THz communica-
tions links. On the other hand, non-terrestrial infrastructures
enable the flexible deployment of a variety of THz sensing
equipment at favorable altitudes and places.
Nevertheless,
the
practical
deployment
of
THz-non-
terrestrial network (NTN) is still facing various technical
challenges, which include but are not limited to the feasibil-
ity assessment of THz frequencies for space-to-earth links,
transceiver implementation, and accurate NTN platform po-
sitioning [442]. Regarding the characterization of THz-NTN
channels, the authors of [443] proposed an analytical propaga-
tion model for low-altitude NTN platforms such as UAVs in
the frequency range 0.275 THz to 3 THz, while the authors of
[444] modeled the cross-link interference for LEO satellites.
The use of satellites to serve air planes on the THz band and
related channel models have been analyzed in [445]. Concern-
ing the THz transceiver implementation, NTN systems pose
high antenna design requirements. For example, the antennas
are supposed to produce multiple high-gain beams to support
dynamic networking and realize long-range communications.
There are various approaches towards this aim, which are
well summarized in the survey by Guo et al. [446]. For
THz CubeSat networks, the antennas are required to provide
sufficient beamwidth angle to enable faster neighbor discovery,
while simultaneously providing a high gain to overcome the
path loss. To fulfill these requirements, Alqaraghuli et al.
designed a two-stage Origami horn antenna [447].
On the PHY layer, digital signal processing techniques are
studied to overcome the limitations of the analog front end in
THz transceivers. Tamesue et al. proposed to deploy digital
predistortion in RF power amplifiers of THz-NTN systems to
compensate for nonlinear distortion [448]. In [449], Kumar
and Arnon reported a DNN beamformer to replace the phase
shifters in THz-MMIMO antenna arrays for wideband LEO
satellite communication. It also creates additional benefits
for NTN by deploying THz communications and sensing
in conjunction with other novel enabling technologies. For
example, RIS can contribute to the deployment of THz in
future integrated terrestrial/non-terrestrial networks by means
of enhancing the beamforming [450]. By leveraging the ISAC
technology, the differential absorption radars (DARs), which
are traditionally used for weather sensing, can be granted an
extra capability of communicating with LEO satellites [451].
E. Digital Twin-Aided THz Systems and Networks
The digital-twin technology [452] is an emerging novel
concept (which is also considered to be a key enabler of
the 6G and beyond systems) in which a virtual replica of a
physical system, object, process, network, or link is created
through employing accurate data collected in real-time [453].
It enables the autonomous control, intelligent monitoring, and
accurate self-optimization of physical networks, processes, and
systems in a fully virtualized environment. To our knowledge,
there exists synergy between the digital-twin technology and
THz communications/sensing networks that can produce a
combined effect on the 6G and beyond aimed at improving the
overall performance in delivering data-driven services. This
synergy stems from the fact that both rely on accurate and
real-time data that is collected from their corresponding data
nodes. On the one hand, THz communications can support the
transmission of large amounts of data generated by digital-
twin nodes by facilitating high-speed communications links
[452], while THz sensing can help the acquisition of high-
accuracy environment data for digital twin. On the other hand,
a digital twin can improve the overall performance of THz
communications and sensing by offering a virtual testing,
monitoring, decision-making, and optimization environment
for the said THz systems and networks [452].
To be specific, digital twins can be utilized to generate
and enable virtual replicas (also known as virtual models) for
manufacturing processes and systems, such as the digital twins
for the machines, links, services, materials, networks, and
products contained in industry. By controlling and monitoring
the virtual replicas in a real-time manner, it can be feasible
to detect and subsequently address any maintenance issues
and bottlenecks that may arise in the said industry, including
device and machine complete failures, unsuccessful service
delivery attempts, and material shortages, among many others.
To enable the digital twinning of the manufacturing industry,
THz communications/sensing systems and networks can be
deployed to acquire, transmit, and receive data (and at some
points enrichment information) between the physical objects
and virtual replicas of the manufacturing systems, enabling
real-time control, accurate decision-making, and autonomous
optimization [454].
In the literature, the relationship between digital-twin tech-
nologies and THz systems has received scant attention. We
uncovered three references addressing this intersection of
the two technologies. First, the authors in [455] proposed
a THz signal guidance system in which a digital twin is
utilized to aim at modeling, controlling, and predicting the
indoor signal propagation features and characteristics. The
authors claim that their methodology achieved the “best” THz
signal path from a nearby base station to the targeted user
equipment using a number of certain models. Second, in
reference [456], the authors proposed a framework that is
based on the THz communications system and aimed at im-
plementing the digital-twin prediction for enabling extremely
security-sensitive systems and objects. Finally, reference [454]
studies the delay minimization optimization problem within
the context of THz communications system and visible light
communications system. In their study, the authors claim that
their approach reduces up to 33.2% transmission delay in
comparison with the traditional methods.
F. AI/ML-Aided THz Systems and Networks
THz communication/sensing systems and AI/ML [457]–
[459] can benefit from each other synergistically. There are
several facets of THz systems that can benefit from the appli-
cation of AI techniques and ML algorithms in 6G and beyond
networks. For example, AI/ML can be employed for (a) signal
processing to enhance the quality of THz signals and reduce
noise; (b) THz channel estimation to be maintained over long

33
distances and not be affected by atmospheric effects; and (c)
the optimization of error correction codes and modulation
schemes. On the one hand, the performance, effectiveness, and
dependability of THz systems and networks can be improved
through the utilization of AI/ML approaches. On the other
hand, THz systems can offer high-speed wireless data transfer
and high-accuracy sensing capabilities that can be helpful for
the deployment of AI/ML services.
In addition, AI/ML technologies can be utilized to create
intelligent and data-driven THz communications and sensing
systems with being capable of adapting to quickly changing
environmental conditions. For instance, with advanced AI/ML
algorithms, a self-healing, self-optimizing, and self-regulating
THz communication and sensing network can be built that can
modify their parameters autonomously to maintain required
performance and service levels. Moreover, AI/ML can be uti-
lized in THz imaging and sensing application use-case scenar-
ios, including security screening, medical diagnosis, industrial
inspection, and many others. THz images can be processed
using AI/ML algorithms to extract enrichment and/or useful
information, resulting in more accurate and reliable results.
The synergistic relationship between AI/ML and THz sys-
tems has also been demonstrated by some recently published
works. During our investigation, we found three papers [55],
[107], [460], which provide an overview of various aspects of
the AI/ML applicability in THz systems and future research
directions in this domain. To be specific, the authors in
[55] provide a survey of the current state-of-the-art research
in THz communication, including signal processing, front-
end chip design, channel modeling, modulation schemes, and
resource management. The paper also highlights the challenges
and opportunities in 6G THz communications systems and
discusses the potential applications of THz communications
in various fields. Reference [460] provides a comprehensive
review of the recent achievements and future challenges of
ML in THz communication. More specifically, the paper sum-
marizes the state-of-the-art research on ML-based THz imag-
ing, sensing, and communications systems, including signal
processing, feature extraction, classification, and optimization.
The paper also discusses the potential applications of ML in
THz technology, such as medical diagnosis, security screening,
and wireless communication, and outlines the future research
directions and challenges in this field. The authors of [107]
cover the fundamentals of THz sensing, including sources of
THz radiation, detection techniques, and applications. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of signal process-
ing techniques, including time-domain and frequency-domain
methods, feature extraction, and classification. It also reviews
recent developments in ML-based THz sensing and highlights
the challenges and future directions for signal processing and
ML techniques in THz sensing.
Finally, and in addition to the above three overview papers
related to THz communications systems, there exist a number
of papers that study ML techniques for time-domain spec-
troscopy and THz imaging [108], the application of AI in THz
healthcare technologies [461], two types of low-cost THz tags
using ML-assisted algorithms [462], and molecular screening
for THz detection using ML-assisted techniques [463].
G. Security in THz Systems and Networks
Resiliency against eavesdropping and other security threats
has become one of the key design priorities. Security measures
are accessible at every layer of a wireless network and
can be integrated across layers to ensure redundancy. These
measures encompass various forms, including software (e.g.,
encryption and authentication at the upper layers), hardware
(e.g., trusted platform modules), and the physical layer (e.g.,
wave-front engineering, near-field antenna modulation, and
polarization multiplexing) [114]. Physical-layer security offers
notable advantages: they do not require a shared private key,
demand minimal additional computing resources, and do not
hinge on the assumption that the attacker possesses limited
computational capacity, making it attractive, especially in THz
systems.
The intersection between physical-layer security and THz
communications and sensing is raised from the particular
properties of THz waves, such as channel sparsity and pencil-
like beams, where an eavesdropper is difficult to intercept
highly directional THz signals. Additionally, the use of ultra-
wide signal bandwidth and spread spectrum techniques can
enhance the security of THz transmission. Spread-spectrum
techniques spread a signal over a wide range of frequencies,
making it hard for signal detection and improving robust-
ness against common jamming attacks [123]. To the best of
our knowledge, physical-layer security can be deployed in
the following aspects of THz communications and sensing:
channel authentication, PHY encryption, beamforming, and
PHY key generation. These security techniques can improve
the security of THz communications and sensing and make
them suitable for a variety of 6G scenarios, such as hot
spots, wireless backhaul, satellite interconnection, industrial
networks, positioning, and imaging.
As of the time of this writing, a number of studies have
uncovered numerous facets of physical-layer security for THz
systems. In [111], a hybrid physical and multi-dimensional
coded modulation scheme for THz communications systems
was proposed. In [464], physical-layer authentication in THz
systems was presented. Following that, some works [112],
[114], [465] were conducted (both based on simulation and
calculation) on resiliency against eavesdropping using a di-
rectional atmosphere-limited LoS THz link. Regarding the
probability of eavesdropping, the authors of [466] have also
investigated about decreasing message detection using inherent
multi-path THz systems. Moreover, a physically secure THz
system operating in 310 GHz using orbital angular momentum
was presented in [467]. Last but not least, it is worth noting
that THz sensing and communications face unique security
challenges that must be addressed. For example, THz waves
can penetrate some materials, including clothing and certain
types of packaging, which could potentially be exploited by
malicious actors [114].
H. Localization Services in THz Systems and Networks
Localization services and THz systems are two completely
different research areas. Nevertheless, they can be integrated
synergistically with being aimed at improving their capabilities

34
and opening up new avenues for a variety of applications
and services in 6G. The intersection of localization and THz
systems results from the unique propagation characteristics
of THz frequencies, which can be utilized for localization
purposes in the access network domain. THz frequencies
are particularly sensitive to rapidly occurring environmental
changes, such as the presence of obstacles (a.k.a. problematic
objects) or changes in the refractive index of materials in an
environment. This extreme sensitivity can be utilized to create
THz-based localization services and systems that can operate
in a variety of environments, including indoor environments
where GPS-based systems may not function optimally.
The integration of localization services into THz systems
and network has the potential to enable a variety of novel
use cases and applications in the 6G era, such as intelligent
factories, manufacturing, healthcare, and many others. THz-
based localization services, for instance, could be used to
track assets within a factory or warehouse, while THz com-
munications could be used to enable high-speed data transfer
between machines and objects in the said factory. THz-based
localization services could be deployed to monitor and control
patient movement within a hospital, while THz communica-
tions could be used to enable wireless video transmission for
remote consultations and many other services.
The intersection between localization services and THz
communications systems has been studied to some extent
in the literature. A tutorial [468] provides a comprehensive
review of THz-band localization techniques for 6G systems.
The authors discussed various aspects of THz waves, including
propagation characteristics, channel modeling, and antenna de-
sign. They also explore different localization methods such as
the time of arrival, angle of arrival, and hybrid techniques. The
paper concludes by highlighting some potential applications
of THz-band localization in 6G networks. In addition, two
research articles discuss various aspects of this intersection. In
[469], the authors proposed a deep learning model for 3D THz
indoor localization using a structured bidirectional long short-
term memory network. The authors claim that their proposed
method achieves better localization accuracy than state-of-
the-art methods, making it a promising solution for indoor
localization in THz-band communications systems. Finally,
reference [470] proposes a new deep learning method for
THz indoor localization called SIABR, utilizing a structured
intra-attention bidirectional recurrent neural network to learn
features from the received signal and estimate the location of
the target.
I. Multi-Connectivity for THz Systems and Networks
Due to the high atmospheric absorption and low penetration
capability, THz signals suffer from such strong propagation
loss, fading, shadowing, and blockage, that they are hard to
maintain with mobility even when beamforming and combin-
ing are ideally performed. To address this issue, THz systems
will need multi-connectivity (MC) as an essential feature so
that a continuous and stable data connection between the
users and the network can be ensured by means of radio
link redundancy in case a single radio link fails. The basic
principle of MC is to keep multiple radio connections to
different BSs simultaneously, but only use one of them at
a time for signal transmission. The effectiveness of multi-
connectivity in addressing the issue of blockage in THz band
has been confirmed by evidence from various studies: a higher
density of BSs is proven to enhance the system performance
from the perspectives of link probability [471], capacity [471],
[472], and session completion rate [473], [474].
Especially, there are two different strategies for selecting
the active radio link, namely the closest line of sight multi-
connectivity (CMC) where the closest BS with LoS link is
always selected for communications and the reactive multi-
connectivity (RMC) in which the active radio link is only re-
selected when the current LoS link is blocked. While the CMC
strategy is significantly outperforming the single-connectivity
strategy, the RMC strategy brings only a marginal - sometimes
even negative - gain, and is therefore discouraged despite
its low signaling overhead [472]. It should also be noted
that the application of MC has an influence on the handover
mechanism since it links the status model. In [475], ¨Ozkoc¸
et al. established an analytical framework to assess the joint
impact of the MC degree and the handover constraints on
system performance of THz cellular networks.
An alternative approach to exploit MC is to allow multiple
BSs to simultaneously serve multiple mobile stations, i.e., each
user may be communicating with multiple BSs rather than one
at a time. This is usually known as the network MIMO or dis-
tributed MIMO (DMIMO), which exploits the spatial diversity
by means of intensifying the BSs instead of antenna units in
each array like in classical MMIMO/UMMIMO. To minimize
the cross-interference among adjacent BSs and maximize the
throughput in DMIMO networks, the coordinated multi-point
(CoMP) technologies shall be invoked. CoMP allows different
BSs to be clustered into small groups, and to coordinately
optimize their user association and beamforming within each
group. More specifically, there are two principles of CoMP: the
joint transmission (JT) where multiple BSs transmit the same
signal simultaneously to the same user equipment (UE), and
the coordinated scheduling and beamforming (CSCB) where
each BS sends a different signal and the signals are combined
at the UE. An example of applying CoMP in the THz band
is presented in [476], which combines joint power allocation
and quantized co-phasing schemes to maximize the aggregated
data rate.
Since the late 2010s, the concepts of DMIMO and CoMP
have evolved into the cell-free network (CFN) paradigm,
where all UEs in an area are jointly served by numerous single-
antenna BSs in a CoMP manner [9]. Having been well studied
at mmWave frequencies, the applicability of CFN in the THz
band still remains under-studied [104]. Pioneering work was
reported in 2022 by Abbasi and Yanikomeroglu [477], consid-
ering a NTN scenario. In some research works [478], multi-
connectivity also refers to establishing connections in different
communications bands, e.g., transmitting control signaling in
the sub-6GHz band while delivering data in the THz band
(also deliver data when the THz band is in an outage).

35
J. Channel Awareness for THz Systems and Networks
While modern wireless data transmission technologies gen-
erally rely on the knowledge of channel state to achieve
satisfactory performance, the acquisition of accurate CSI can
be a critical challenge for THz systems and networks. First, the
pilot symbols can be easily blocked due to the susceptibility of
THz channels, leading to a low efficiency of classical chan-
nel estimation methods. Second, THz channels are selective
regarding many different parameters, e.g., time, frequency,
beam pattern, beam direction, polarization, etc. Therefore, it
takes much effort to comprehensively measure the CSI of a
THz channel, in addition to a significant overhead to encode
the dimensional and sparse CSI. Similar to the pilots, the
CSI reported from UE to the network can also be blocked
if transmitted in the THz band itself [60].
Regarding these challenges, the out-of-band channel estima-
tion occurs as a promising solution. This involves acquiring
the CSI of THz channels using the channel estimation at lower
frequencies, leveraging the spatial correlation. To assess the
feasibility of this approach, the authors of [479] and [480]
studied the spatial similarity among THz, mmWave, and sub-
6 GHz bands based on point cloud ray-tracing simulation and
field measurement. Their results support the use of out-of-
band beam search strategy, not only in LoS scenarios but
also even in NLoS ones, when using well-designed antenna
patterns in specific frequency bands. Meanwhile, Peng et al.
demonstrated the feasibility of out-of-band channel estimation
beam searching with both ray-tracing simulations [389] and
real-world experiments [481].
However, the exploitation of channel similarity for THz
communications and sensing is still facing technical chal-
lenges. First, the difference in the size of the antenna array
within the same aperture leads to a mismatch in the beamwidth
between the lower frequencies and the THz ones [60], which
is proven to have a strong impact on channel similarity
than the frequency gap itself [480]. Second, the correlation
matrix is difficult to estimate, considering its large size and
the small dimension of antenna arrays measuring at lower
frequencies [60]. Third, despite the feasibility of out-of-band
estimation on static THz channels, the dynamics such as
user mobility, scatter mobility, and blockages, are lifting the
difficulty of this task to the next level [479].

### Integrated THz Communications and Sensing (Section IX excerpt)

```text
IX. INTEGRATED THZ COMMUNICATIONS AND SENSING
The novel concepts of “network as a sensor” and “Internet
of Senses” are becoming unprecedented essentials in the
upcoming 6G and beyond cellular networks so as to support a
multitude of emerging use cases [18]. The two major function-
alities, i.e., communications and sensing (including positioning
and imaging), will be merged, synergized, and integrated,
benefiting from each other rather than competing for network
resources. Future base stations are supposed to provide not
only legacy communication services but also localization,
sensing, and even electromagnetic imaging capabilities, acting
as dual-functional ISAC transceivers [482], [483].

(DFRC) [484]. It aims for enhanced spectral and energy effi-
ciency, reduced hardware cost, and decreased power consump-
tion as well as deployment and computational complexity.
In the literature, such as [47], [53], [468], [485]–[487], THz
sensing, imaging, localization, and communications are treated
separately. Different from these, we in this section provide
a holistic survey on the recent activities in integrated THz
communications and sensing. Special attention is paid to use
cases and KPIs, waveform design, algorithm development,
RIS-boosted ISAC, and potential challenges and solutions. The
architectural overview of THz ISAC is depicted in Fig. 9,
and the selected major contributions related to THz ISAC are
summarized in Table X.
A. THz-ISAC Use Cases and KPIs
Localization and sensing, including determining the 2D/3D
location and EM properties of objects, alongside multi-scale
communications enable a multitude of emerging use cases,
which may have different functional and non-functional QoS
requirements in terms of accuracy, range, latency, velocity,
update rate, reliability, and availability. The use case families
consist of various vertical applications, e.g., massive twin-
ning, immersive telepresence, wireless extended reality (XR),
cooperative robots, THz internet-of-things (Tera-IoT), local
trust zones, vehicular communication and radar sensing [498],
and THz integrated access and backhaul (IAB). In general,
these fall into the category of data-demanding and delay-
sensitive applications. However, the QoS requirements differ
from one use case to another. For instance, manufacturing and
smart cities, as two sub-categories of massive twining, need
different accuracy, data rates, latency, update rates, reliability,
and availability [18]. A full list of selected use cases and their
corresponding performance metrics can be referred to [18],
[35], [56], [59], [110], [488], [499]–[502], closely tied to
these of upcoming 6G and beyond systems, for which the
ultimate goal would be realizing terabit-per-second links and
millimeter-level sensing/localization accuracy [110], [503].
B. THz-ISAC Waveform Design
THz channels usually have short delay spread and THz
transceivers suffer from low power amplifier (PA) efficiency
(rapid decline on its saturated output power). Besides, fre-
quency selectivity becomes less severe. As a result, coherence
bandwidth increases. Therefore, the single-carrier waveform is
more preferred compared to the orthogonal frequency-division

multiplexing (OFDM) waveform [504]. Sensing integrated
DFT-spread-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (SI-
DFT-s-OFDM) can yield lower PAPR than OFDM while
maintaining single-carrier characteristic, as reported in [489],
[490], [505]. In addition, it brings a ten-fold improvement
in velocity estimation of the moving target and significant
enhancement on data rate, beneficial from the FGI approach,
which is capable of reducing the cyclic prefix (CP) overhead.
In ISAC systems, communication and sensing channels may
possess different properties. For instance, a sensing channel
can expose a significant delay spread. Thus, different design
criteria for communications and sensing waveforms should be
considered in terms of cyclic prefix lengths and pilots [505].
Another type of intensively studied waveform, so-called
orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), can well handle
the Doppler effect and accommodate the channel dynamics
in the delay-Doppler domain. Nevertheless, it still can not
meet the strict requirements of power amplifier efficiency
and signal processing complexity. Similar to SI-DFT-s-OFDM,
DFT-s-OTFS was proposed to address the high PAPR issue
faced in the original OTFS [490]. In contrast to OTFS,
DFT-s-OTFS can achieve strong robustness to Doppler spread
compared to OFDM and DFT-spread-OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)
and reach lower PAPR compared to its OTFS counterpart [59],
[490], [506]. By imposing superimposed pilots in the delay-
Doppler domain alongside the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) precoding operation, THz ISAC system facilitates low-
complexity iterative channel estimation and data detection.
Because of the aforementioned advantages, DFT-s-OTFS is the
most promising candidate waveform for THz ISAC systems.
C. THz-ISAC Algorithm Development
The ISAC algorithms typically fall into three categories, i.e.,
the data-driven AI-based approaches, model-based approaches,
and hybrid approaches (a combination of the former two). AI
techniques rely on large-volume date sets for training cus-
tomized neural network (NN) models for sensing, localization,
and signal detection, while tackling the mathematically in-
tractable non-linearity issues from, e.g., phase noise and offset,
power amplifier, and mutual coupling. On the contrary, for the

37
model-based ISAC algorithms, the majority of them need to
harness the well-justified domain knowledge and modeling,
such as geometric relationship among the transceivers and
the environmental objects, and take full advantage of channel
sparsity in the form of rank deficiency of the channel matrix or
a limited number of resolvable paths, as to obtain satisfactory
performance.
Under the framework of THz ISAC, joint data detection
(signal recovery) and sensing parameter estimation are con-
ducted with multi-task NNs in [504]. In a broad sense, the
ML roles on ISAC can be classified into three categories:
• joint sensing and communication (JSAC)
• sensing-aided communications [62], [63]
• communication-aided sensing [64].
To be specific, the first category includes the following
activities: JSAC waveform design, spatial beam pattern design,
inter- and self-interference cancellation, resource allocation,
etc. Without any doubt, communications and sensing can be
mutually beneficial for each other. In the category of sensing-
aided communication, sensing information (treated as prior
information), e.g., the location of the transmitter, receiver,
and environmental objects, can be leveraged for enhancing
the beam prediction/alignment and reducing the overhead of
beam training as well as channel sounding [487], [491]. In
dynamic scenarios where the user is under mobility, regardless
of low or high velocity, such sensing information can be
utilized for predicting potential blockages and enabling smooth
handovers [22]. Similarly, communication signals can also
be exploited to boost the sensing performance during the
data transmission phase. The back-scattered data signals can
gradually refine/improve the sensing parameter estimation,
similar to data-aided channel estimation in the literature [507].
The DL algorithms alongside other counterparts, e.g.,
deep reinforcement learning and transfer learning, pave the
way for the integrated detectors and estimators for both
communications and sensing, in terms of e.g., sensing
parameters estimation, interference mitigation/cancellation,
beam
tracking/prediction,
and
network
resource
alloca-
tion/management [107], [489]. Meanwhile, it can successfully
tackle the mathematically intractable non-linearity issues and
hardware impairments in ISAC systems [489]. Furthermore,
the latent features related to sensing parameters can be more
readily learned and extracted by the adoption of DL algo-
rithms. For instance, two sensing neural network (SensingNet)
models, one for range estimation and the other for velocity
estimation, were proposed in [489], composed of an input
layer, a flatting layer, five dense layers for feature extrac-
tion and nonlinear mapping, and an average output layer.
Meanwhile, a concatenated two-level communication neural
network (ComNet) model for data detection was developed,
where the first level is leveraged for channel information
acquisition and its output is further utilized in the second level.
Combining both the SensingNet and ComNet models bring us
a promising DL-empowered solution for THz ISAC systems.
It should be noted that other DL variants can also be adopted
for both sensing and communication applications.
In the DFT-s-OTFS system [490], a two-stage sensing
parameter estimation approach was proposed, i.e., coarse
on-grid search in the first stage followed by refined off-
grid search in the second stage for extracting the sensing
parameters. Under the framework of ISAC, data detection
and sensing parameter estimation can be performed in an
iterative manner by considering the conjugate gradient method
until a certain preset stopping criterion is reached. Besides,
ISAC performance can be further enhanced by multi-domain
cooperation through joint active and passive sensing, and
multi-user and multi-frequency operations [491]. The tensor
decomposition approach is capable of leveraging the channel
sparsity and guaranteeing a unique solution for each environ-
mental sensing parameter without any ambiguity [501]. Such
sensed information can be then utilized to reconstruct a high-
resolution indoor mapping to further boost the prediction of
blockages and the availability of LoS path, and reduce the
beam tracking frequency. Thus, higher spectrum efficiency in
data transmission can be achieved accordingly.
The traditional model-based algorithms adopt compressive
sensing techniques, on-the-grid, off-the-grid, and the com-
bination of the former two (e.g., in [490]), for extracting
channel and sensing parameters by taking advantage of chan-
nel sparsity [508]–[510]. Model-driven end-to-end learning,
falling into the category of hybrid approaches, for joint single
target sensing and precoder design in MISO communication
networks was studied in [492]. In particular, the authors jointly
consider precoder design at the transmitter and target AoA
estimation at the receiver by applying an autoencoder (AE)
while accounting for the hardware impairment. During the
model-driven end-to-end learning, the matrix composed of
steering vectors at discretized grid points is considered as
trainable parameters to simplify the transmit precoder design
and optimized by only maximizing the sensing-related perfor-
mance metric [492].
D. RIS-Boosted THz-ISAC
With the newly-introduced capability of manipulating the
radio propagation environment, RIS is able to expand the
communication coverage and enhance the sensing perfor-
mance [484], [511]. The potential roles that can be played
by an RIS are multi-fold: scattering, reflecting, refraction,
absorption, polarization, and diffraction. With all the preceding
degree of freedom (DoF), intelligent, programmable wireless
propagation environments can be established for different
tasks, e.g., communications, sensing, localization, and imag-
ing. The RIS can enrich the LoS availability by establishing
a virtual one when the real one is suffering from temporary
blockage, which frequently occurs at THz frequencies.
The various benefits of integrating RIS into ISAC were
discussed in [512]. The gains against the RIS-free counterpart
heavily rely on the cross-correlation between the sensing and
communication channels. The more the mutual coupling, the
more gain can be accomplished in terms of ISAC performance.
By introducing the RIS, enhanced flexibility and adaptation
to channel dynamics is seen in altering the coupling level
of these channels [512]. The importance of tight coupling
of communications and localization was also emphasized
in [513] for the purpose of harnessing the full potential

38
of RISs. That is to say, the simultaneous localization and
communications (SLAC) requires smart RIS control, co-design
of communications and localization, and the flexible trade-off
and reinforcement between the two functionalities.
In the rich RIS-boosted ISAC literature, various optimiza-
tion problems are formulated with different objectives along
with different constraints. These works can be cast into three
different classes:
• sensing-centric design [493]
• communication-centric design [494]
• joint design and optimization [19], [495].
For the first category, the objective is sensing-oriented,
while the communication metrics are taken as constraints.
For instance, the authors of [493] maximized the SNR at the
radar while considering a communication SNR constraint. By
addressing this optimization problem, semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) along with bisection search was considered for transmit
beamforming design while majority-minimization is consid-
ered for RIS design. With respect to the second category, the
reference [494] takes interference among the communication
users as the objective while treating the desired mean square
error (MSE) of DoA estimation as a constraint. To be specific,
the authors developed an alternating optimization algorithm for
finding the optimal design of constant-modulus waveform and
discrete RIS phase shifts for the RIS-assisted ISAC systems.
For the former design, manifold optimization algorithm was
considered, while for the later design, two schemes, one based
on manifold optimization and the other based on successive
optimization, were proposed. In terms of the last category, the
weighted sum of two objectives, one for communications and
the other for sensing, are usually considered [495]. Similar to
that in [494], an alternating optimization algorithm based on
oblique manifold optimization alongside Riemannian steepest
descent was introduced to jointly optimize the DFRC wave-
form and RIS phase shift matrix. All the above categories share
some common constraints, e.g., individual transmit power,
sum transmit power, hardware (especially for RIS, e.g., phase
quantization, constant modulus of amplitude), etc. A holistic
comparison among the three classes can be referred to [20],
[488].
Recently, a more promising type of RIS, termed as simulta-
neously transmitting (refracting) and reflecting reconfigurable
intelligent surface (STAR-RIS), was introduced, which is able
to offer additional benefits thanks to its inherent dual-mode
operation and full-dimensional coverage [514], [515]. The
STAR-RIS can concurrently reflect and refract the incident
signals towards multiple desired MSs. Because of this, the
STAR-RIS can further boost the ISAC performance compared
to the sole-reflection-type RIS [496], [516], [517] with ex-
tended flexibility. Either an outdoor or indoor BS is capable
of providing both communications and sensing services to the
users located indoors and outdoors by installing a STAR-RIS
on a transparent glass window [514], [515].
E. Challenges and Solutions for THz-ISAC
The open problems for THz-ISAC are listed and discussed
in [18], [504]. For example, waveform design should be cus-
tomized depending on sensing applications. Dynamic beam-
forming control faces great challenges since the beamwidth
is narrow and highly directional [35]. As a consequence, the
probability of beam misalignment can be inevitably high. A
robust design of candidate beams for communication purposes
requires a wider beamwidth. However, to enhance the sensing
resolution and accuracy, narrow beams are preferred. Multiple
concurrent beams comprise one fixed sub-beam for point-to-
point communications and multiple time-varying sub-beams
for sensing purposes can achieve a well-balanced performance
between communications and sensing [110]. However, multi-
ple simultaneous beams suffer from degraded beamforming
gains.
Imperfections, resulting from IQ imbalance, PA nonlinear
distortions, and phase noise at the local oscillator, need to be
compensated for when designing robust THz-ISAC algorithms.
The wide-band channel becomes highly selective with high
Doppler spread, which may break the orthogonality of OFDM
transmission and incur inter-carrier interference [484], [497].
Besides, the near-filed propagation, where channel sparsity
vanishes in the angular domain, makes the beamforming
design intractable. However, a recent study [518] shows that
sparse representations of the near-field channel from the polar
domain are still available, making efficient CSI acquisition
feasible with the aid of advanced compressive sensing tech-
niques.
The beam squint effect makes the designed beam deviate
from the exact one, resulting in reduced array gain and perfor-
mance degradation [497]. The beam squint and split effect will
become more obvious as the increase of carrier frequency and
bandwidth, causing significant performance degradation on
sensing and communication. As examined in [484] for a broad-
side target, beam split can reach as much as 4◦for 0.3 THz
with 30 GHz bandwidth while it is only 1.4◦for 60 GHz with
2 GHz bandwidth. This effect should be mitigated and com-
pensated for when designing the beamforming patterns, such
as DPP [519]. By introducing a time delay network between
the RF chains and frequency-independent phase shifters in the
hybrid precoding architecture, DPP is capable of performing
frequency-dependent delay-phase controlled beamforming for
reducing the array gain loss introduced by the beam split
effect. The newly-introduced time delays can make beams
aligned with the target physical directions across the entire
bandwidth. Due to the user mobility and frequent blockage,
beam misalignment occurs when LoS path is unavailable
between the BS and MS. Provided that the user can be tracked
and blockage can be predicted in advance, beam misalignment
can be avoided. However, this requires high-precision sensing
information. In line with the 5G CSI acquisition signals, the
authors in [520] adopt synchronization signal block (SSB) for
blockage detection and reference signal (RS) for user tracking.
Until all the above-mentioned challenges are thoroughly
addressed in the forthcoming years, the vision that everything
will be sensed, connected, and intelligent can be fulfilled.

A novel UWB fiber-THz-fiber seamlessly converged real-time ar-

optical module to realize ultrahigh-capacity THz real-time wireless
communication, is proposed.
towards 6G and beyond, we summarize state-of-the-art THz
trials and experiments worldwide in this section, where the
achieved data rates at the certain THz bands with specific
features are surveyed.
In the past decade, the electronic mixing technology was
widely applied to generate high-frequency THz signals by
up-converting a low-frequency microwave signal, as the tradi-
tional way to realize THz transmission as listed in Table XI
[521], [523], [524]. One of the most remarkable approaches
was done by Bell Labs in 2011, where THz radiation at
625 GHz was generated by using an all-solid-state electric
mixer. It achieved a data rate of 2.5 Gbps at a distance of
0.2 m under the transmission power of 1 mW [521]. In 2015,
the researchers at the University of Stuttgart in Germany
successfully transmitted 240 GHz THz signals to the receiver
at a distance of 850 m. The trial achieved a peak data rate of
64 Gbps using quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and 8-
ary phase-shift keying (8PSK) modulation in a single-channel
approach without the use of spatial diversity [523]. In the
year 2017, a research team from the China Academy of
Engineering Physics achieved ultra-long-distance THz wire-
less communications over up to 21 km and realized single-

40
channel transmission speed up to 5 Gbps, taking advantage
of two Cassegrain antennas with 50 dBi gain each [524]. In
the same year, the first demonstration of photonically-enabled
independent side-bands D-Band wireless transmission up to
352 Gbps by means of 2×2 antenna polarization multiplexing
was achieved [532].
Because of the inherent properties of electronic devices,
the parameters of high-frequency electronic devices gradually
approach the theoretical limit, with relatively lower bandwidth
and a limited transmission rate. Recently, much attention was
shifted to the photonics-assisted heterodyne beating technique
for higher data rate and better signal quality, where the rates
of THz transmission is able to reach hundreds of Gbps or
even Tbps [522], [525]–[529]. It should be pointed out that
the THz signal power generated by the photonics-assisted
heterodyne beating method is usually limited to the mW level
because of the lower responsivity of the uni-traveling carrier
photodiode (UTC-PD), resulting in the limited transmission
distance. Therefore, some researchers utilized high-gain THz
amplifiers or high-gain lens antennas to extend distances to
100 m. In early 2013, the researchers [522] utilized the large
frequency range in the THz window between 200 GHz and
300 GHz to implement a single-input single-output (SISO)
wireless 100 Gbps link with a carrier frequency of 237.5 GHz
over a distance of 20 m. Several years later, a team from
Fudan University, China successfully applied 2×2 MIMO and
wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technologies at THz
signal transmission, achieving a data rate of 120 Gbps by using
QPSK modulation [525]. Meanwhile, some researchers at Zhe-
jiang University in China achieved THz signal transmission
of 600 Gbps using 64QAM multi-carrier modulation [526].
However, the distances of THz signal transmission of the
above two approaches are only 1.42 m and 2.8 m, respectively.
In the past three years, some research teams have presented
prominent improvements in THz communications. The wire-
less transmission distances were effectively extended to more
than 100 m with the assistance of high-gain THz amplifiers or
high-gain lens antenna. In 2020, a team at Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology (KIT), Germany took advantage of THz am-
plifiers and the Kramers-Kronig method for simplifying the
design of the receiver and launched an offline multi-carrier
THz system. It offers a peak data rate of 115 Gbps at a
carrier frequency of 300 GHz over a distance of 110 m [527].
One year later, the Fudan University in China successfully
transmitted a 44.8 Gbps 64QAM-modulated signal over a
distance of 104 m without using the THz amplifier but utilizing
both suitable dielectric lenses and digital signal processing
(DSP) algorithms [528]. In the same year, Yannik Horst et al.
[529] from Switzerland demonstrated the transparent optical-
THz-optical link, providing a transmission rate of 240 Gbps
over a distance up to 115 m.
With the objective of achieving full-coverage and low-
cost deployment towards future 6G mobile communications,
the priority of the hybrid optoelectronic down-conversation
solution was presented [530] and [531], where a novel fiber-
THz-fiber seamlessly converged real-time architecture was
successfully demonstrated. It adopts both dual-polarization
photonic up-conversion for THz signal generation and hybrid
optoelectronic down-conversion for THz reception, by thor-
oughly reusing commercial digital coherent optical modules.
In the case of hybrid channel transmission with two hops
consisting of a 20km-long fiber and 1m-long THz wireless
link, a THz signal with a net rate of 206.25 Gbps was
successfully transmitted real-timely [531]. It is also pointed
out that zhe THz phased array techniques are key to realizing
6G THz mobile communications and sensing, which meets
the needs of application scenarios, such as multiple users and
beam tracking.
In addition to the excellent demonstrations and valida-
tions that have been achieved by research teams around
the world, some equipment suppliers and organizations have
also presented great advances in THz commercialization. The
NYU WIRELESS is currently focusing on sub-THz bands at
140 GHz, 220 GHz, and higher. The radio-frequency integrated
circuit (RFIC) probe stations working up to 220 GHz, and
channel sounders for propagation measurement at 140 GHz
[100] are provided by the Keysight Technologies. Keysight
has also closely corporated with Nokia Bell labs on the sub-
THz testbed, which was chosen to verify the performance
of transceiver modules, power amplifiers, and antennas under
both linear and nonlinear conditions. Recently, the Huawei
6G research team has developed and demonstrated THz in-
tegrated sensing and communications (THz-ISAC) prototype.
Using wireless electromagnetic waves, the prototype can sense
and produce images of blocked objects with millimeter-level
resolution and communicates at an ultra-high rate of 240 Gbps,
opening up new service possibilities for 6G and beyond
systems [61].
