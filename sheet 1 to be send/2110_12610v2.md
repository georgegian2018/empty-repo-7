arrays can serve multiple wireless users simultaneously. As
beamforming is realized in the RF domain, the beam synthesis
of phased arrays is called analog beamforming, or single-RF-
chain beamforming.
We consider an end-to-end communication scenario, where
the transmitter sends signal s to the receiver with power P. The
transmitter, equipped with Nt antennas, can perform transmit
beamforming (also known as precoding) with

performance, such as increasing SNR and reducing power
consumption. Note that in general, all the PAs have the same

time [22], [34]. The structure of a digital array is shown in
Fig. 4. For each channel, ADC and digital-to-analog converter
(DAC) are required to receive and transmit baseband signals,
and digital beamforming is implemented in the baseband
by digital weighting. Since each antenna is connected to
an independent RF chain, multi-stream transmission can be
supported. Supposing that a signal vector s ∈CNs×1 is
transmitted from the transmitter to the receiver with power
P, then the received signal vector at the receiver is given by

Fig. 7. Sub-array techniques for realizing multiple beams.
A. New Beamforming Technologies
Traditional beamforming techniques may not be suitable for
future space/air/ground communication networks that require
massive access and high dynamic due to the limited number of
RF chains and high cost. Therefore, some new beamforming
techniques have attracted wide concern and study.
1) Single-RF-Chain Multiple Beams: To balance hardware
cost and beam gain in antenna array enabled communication
systems, hybrid beamforming structure is a suitable paradigm,
in which a few RF chains are able to be connected to a large
antenna array. In general, the number of served users is no
more than the number of RF chains because one RF chain can
only shape one data stream. As the number of users increases,
covering all the users becomes challenging due to the limited
number of RF chains. Hence, single-RF chain

where I is the total number of desired beams. α is a slack
variable to improve the beam gain along the desired directions.
It is shown in [32], [44] that with the optimization approach
multiple beams can also be well shaped.
In addition to the sub-array and optimization techniques,
the RF chain can also be connected to a lens antenna array,
which is a new path division multiplexing paradigm as shown
in Fig. 8, using power splitter/mixer and switch to gener-
ate multiple beams [45]. The RF chain can select different
antennas to connect in order to generate beams steering to
different directions after lens refraction, which greatly reduces
beamforming complexity and hardware cost.

space ranging from 0 to 0.5, four sub-arrays are needed. In
addition to the sub-array scheme, optimization scheme is also
an effective method to design wide beam. For example, in
order to form wide beams to ensure the coverage of broadcast
control signals for massive MIMO systems, an alternating
optimization algorithm was proposed in [48] to optimize the
hybrid precoder, which required the coverage probability for
each user to be larger than a pre-determined threshold, and
the transmit power to be as small as possible.
For certain special user distributions, a wide beam with
circular covered area may not be appropriate because of
unnecessary power cost in areas without users. Flexible beam
coverage that can cover an area with arbitrary shape and size
is more practical. A 3D beamforming approach with a uniform
plane array (UPA) to

scheme with G=3 requires 5 SIC layers at the receivers and
achieves signiﬁcantly lower performance. This demonstrates
how RSMA can achieve signiﬁcant performance gain with
relatively low receiver complexity thanks to the ability to
partially decode interference and partially treat it as noise [83].
RSMA can adjust the amount of interference that is decoded
at each user by adjusting the common stream (power and
content). Since SDMA treats inter-beam interference as noise
and NOMA fully decodes the interference, the two schemes
(along with OMA and other schemes as multicasting) can be
seen as special cases of RSMA [75], [76]. This shows how
powerful RSMA can be at unifying unrelated multiple access
techniques into a single framework seemingly.

assumption of perfect C

transmitters and passive RISs is a crucial problem. Generally
speaking, the deployment of RISs should consider the link
conditions with both transmitters and receivers, spatial user
density, inter-cell interference issue, and so on [41], [88].
Besides, passive beamforming design is essential to steer the
reﬂected signals toward the desired directions. To optimize the
network performance, passive beamforming of RIS is neces-
sarily jointly designed with active beamforming of transmit-
ters/receivers [89]–[91]. It is preferable to consider practical
hardware constraints such as discrete amplitude and phase-
shift levels [92]–[94] in the beamforming design, to ensure
practical communication performance. Moreover, the combi-
nation of RIS with other technologies such as NOMA [88],
[95], [96] and terahertz communications [97], [98], and the

In addition to conventional modulation such as PSK and
QAM, RIS-based transmitter can also realize various reﬂection
pattern-related modulation schemes [105]–[109]. Essentially,
these schemes map information bits to different phase shift
matrices of the RIS, while the receiver can demodulate the
information through detecting which phase shift matrix is used.
For example, Fig. 13 shows a RIS-based index modulation
system proposed in [108], which maps the information to the
index of receive antenna. Speciﬁcally, the receiver equipped
with NR antennas lies in the far-ﬁled of the RIS-based

Fig. 14. Here, a transmitter
(Alice) wishes to convey a message to a legitimate receiver
(Bob) while keeping it secret from an eavesdropper (Eve). In a
nutshell, for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels,
if the SNR γBob of the channel between Alice and Bob,
which is called the legitimate channel, is higher than that γEve
of the channel between Alice and Eve, which is called the
wiretap channel, secure communication is possible from Alice
to Bob [116]. Suppose that Alice and Bob are equipped with
Nt-element and Nr-element phased arrays, respectively. Thus,
precoding and combining can be performed. The legitimate
channel is denoted by H. We suppose that Eve is equipped
with a single antenna and the wiretap channel is denoted
by hEve. Then, the received SNRs of Bob and Eve are

main information, i.e., elevation angle and azimuth angle
can be utilized to save the pilot overhead, rapidly establish
and reliably maintain communication links for A2G com-
munications [161], [162] and A2A communications [163].
Airborne sensors which provide movement state information,
like GPS and micro inertial measurement unit, can assist the
coarse beam alignment [164]. Besides, machine learning-based
schemes, such as Q-learning [165], long short-term memory
recurrent neural network [166] were exploited to assist beam
tracking, for their ability to predict beam alignment based on
sequential beam tracking experience. In summary, the high

full DoFs. Beneﬁting from the additional DoF of FD-MIMO,
ﬂexible 3D beamforming can be employed in BSs to achieve
effective interference coordination in cellular networks [206],
[207]. Nevertheless, both the works in [206] and [207] utilize
statistical CSI in order to reduce the feedback overhead of
channel estimation. How to obtain instantaneous CSI is a great
challenge for large-scale antenna arrays. Fortunately, the use
of RSMA in large-scale antenna array and massive MIMO
systems has been shown to boost the performance over conven-
tional massive MIMO in the presence of imperfect CSI due to
frequency division duplexing (FDD) quantization [208], [209],
time division duplexing (TDD) pilot contamination [210],
phase noise and hardware impairments [211], or due to mo-
bility and latency [212].

performance. It is proved that the cell-free massive MIMO
signiﬁcantly outperforms small-cell in both median and 95%-
likely performance. What is worth noting is that the cell-free
massive MIMO system can provide almost 20-fold increase
in 95%-likely per-user throughput compared with small-cell
system [222]. Moreover, the simulation results in [225] shown
that the 95%-likely per-user throughput of cell-free system can
be further improved through increasing antenna number.
One of the main challenges to design cell-free massive
MIMO is how to achieve a network that is scalable in the sense
of being implementable in a large network. Speciﬁcally, how

A. New Beamforming Technologies
Traditional beamforming techniques may not be suitable for
future space/air/ground communication networks that require
massive access and high dynamic due to the limited number of
RF chains and high cost. Therefore, some new beamforming
techniques have attracted wide concern and study.
1) Single-RF-Chain Multiple Beams: To balance hardware
cost and beam gain in antenna array enabled communication
systems, hybrid beamforming structure is a suitable paradigm,
in which a few RF chains are able to be connected to a large
antenna array. In general, the number of served users is no
more than the number of RF chains because one RF chain can
only shape one data stream. As the number of users increases,
covering all the users becomes challenging due to the limited
number of RF chains. Hence, single-RF chain

space ranging from 0 to 0.5, four sub-arrays are needed. In
addition to the sub-array scheme, optimization scheme is also
an effective method to design wide beam. For example, in
order to form wide beams to ensure the coverage of broadcast
control signals for massive MIMO systems, an alternating
optimization algorithm was proposed in [48] to optimize the
hybrid precoder, which required the coverage probability for
each user to be larger than a pre-determined threshold, and
the transmit power to be as small as possible.
For certain special user distributions, a wide beam with
circular covered area may not be appropriate because of
unnecessary power cost in areas without users. Flexible beam
coverage that can cover an area with arbitrary shape and size
is more practical. A 3D beamforming approach with a uniform
plane array (UPA) to

scheme with G=3 requires 5 SIC layers at the receivers and
achieves signiﬁcantly lower performance. This demonstrates
how RSMA can achieve signiﬁcant performance gain with
relatively low receiver complexity thanks to the ability to
partially decode interference and partially treat it as noise [83].
RSMA can adjust the amount of interference that is decoded
at each user by adjusting the common stream (power and
content). Since SDMA treats inter-beam interference as noise
and NOMA fully decodes the interference, the two schemes
(along with OMA and other schemes as multicasting) can be
seen as special cases of RSMA [75], [76]. This shows how
powerful RSMA can be at unifying unrelated multiple access
techniques into a single framework seemingly.

One possible method for single-RF-chain multi-beam is to
divide the antenna array into several sub-arrays and each sub-
array can generate a beam pointing to a speciﬁc direction as
shown in Fig. 7 (a). A certain number of adjacent antennas
are separated in a group to form multiple sub-arrays that
can generate analog beams steering to desired users [42],
[43]. We present the simulation results of generating multiple
beams via sub-array techniques. First, a phased array with
64 elements is uniformly divided into two sub-arrays and
four sub-arrays, respectively. Then, analog beamforming is
performed to generate multiple beams pointing to different
directions. As shown in Fig. 7 (b), with different numbers
of sub-arrays, the number of beams can be adjusted ﬂexibly.
Besides, as the number of sub-arrays increases, the number of
antennas in each sub-array decreases, which results in a loss
of the beam gain. Therefore, the tradeoff between the number

board (PCB), while the transmissive metasurface requires a

requiring no phase shifter and attenuator. Then compared to
phased arrays, the programmable metasurface is much cheaper.
Nevertheless, it may have disadvantages of a higher sidelobe
level and lower efﬁciency.
Taking the reﬂective metasurface as an example, the signal

sends a signal s, which arrives at the n-th element of the

Fix-beam Antenna Arrays
Fix-beam antenna arrays include single beam arrays and
multiple beam arrays (MBAs). The single beam arrays usually
consist of radiation elements and relatively simple feeding
network, which are cheap to be exploited to track satellites and
airplanes on an electronic-controlled turntable. MBAs are usu-
ally installed on the satellite to serve users in different regions
with multiple narrow beams generated by the Butler matrix,
lens, reﬂector antennas with multiple feedings. The lens-
based MBAs mainly include the Rotman lens and Luneberg
lens [31]. The Rotman lens has a two-dimensional (2D) true-
time delay. By moving the position of the feed, the phase
differences between the adjacent output port of the lens will
be changed, thus the radiation beam points to different angles.

wireless communications, the hybrid antenna arrays are also
exploited in massive MIMO systems to decrease the cost with
hybrid precoding and combining [36]. For a hybrid antenna
array, a large number of antennas are connected with small
amount of RF chains via phase shifters, and thus multi-stream
transmission are enabled with high gains and relatively low
cost. Let N RF
