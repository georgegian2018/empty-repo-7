## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 5G Communication Systems Context

Fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks are currently being deployed globally and promise significantly higher data rates compared to previous-generation legacy systems. One key approach to achieving these higher data rates involves utilizing radio frequency bands above 6 GHz, which provide greater bandwidth capacity.

### 1.2 NR Frequency Range Classification

In the 3GPP standard designation:
- **NR FR2 (New Radio Frequency Range 2):** Radio frequency bands above 6 GHz, commonly referred to as millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands
- **NR FR1:** Legacy below-6 GHz radio frequencies

### 1.3 Research Gap - Human Body Effects at mmWave

Despite the increasing relevance of NR FR2 (mmWave) bands for 5G implementation, significant research gaps remain:
- Effects of human body on antenna gains and losses have received relatively limited attention at NR FR2 frequencies
- While substantial studies have provided insights into robust mobile phone antenna array configurations in realistic environments with human body present, clear and comprehensive design guidelines for mobile antenna systems are still missing
- Empirical evaluation results of manufactured antenna elements and arrays at NR FR2 are particularly scarce due to measurement challenges

### 1.4 Measurement Challenges - The Phantom Problem

One of the major obstacles in performing empirical evaluation of antennas under the influence of mobile phone users is the lack of standardized human body phantoms.

**Current State:**
- All works reporting empirical evaluation of antenna radiation or radio-link characteristics with a mobile user employ real human subjects
- Measured antenna radiation characteristics obtained with real human subjects exhibit poor repeatability
- This makes comparison of different designs and standardized testing difficult

### 1.5 Need for Repeatable Testing

Repeatable measurements with a standardized phantom would enable:
- Comparison of performance across different antenna array configurations
- Identification of array configurations robust against electromagnetic interaction with human body including shadowing effects
- Standardized device conformance testing
- Development of design guidelines based on repeatable data

### 1.6 Previous Phantom Research

Earlier works on human body phantoms have been published, but these were generally not designed specifically for evaluation of mobile phone antennas in close proximity to the body.

### 1.7 Research Solution Proposed

The authors developed a human body phantom specifically designed for repeatable antenna evaluation at millimeter-wave frequencies.

**Implementation:**
- Phantom integrated into far-field antenna measurement facility
- Empirical evaluation of gains of phased antenna array on mobile phone chassis
- Single transceiver chain configuration tested

**Test Array Design:**
- Co-located array configuration with two modules
- Patch antenna arrays at two locations on mobile phone chassis
- Allows collection of multipath powers from different directions

### 1.8 Validation Methodology

**Comparison Approach:**
- Experimental measurements using simple hexagonal body phantom
- Numerical simulations using realistic human body model
- Statistical comparison using spherical coverage metrics

### 1.9 Spherical Coverage as Evaluation Metric

Spherical coverage analysis represents the empirical statistics of maximum antenna gains that an array can realize for all possible angles on a complete sphere. This metric:
- Is used to estimate coverage efficiency
- Has been adopted by 3GPP as standard metric for evaluating and ranking phased antenna arrays
- Provides comprehensive performance characterization

## 2. HUMAN BODY PHANTOMS

### 2.1 Overview of Phantom Development

Two complementary phantom approaches were developed:
1. **Numerical Phantom:** Used for identifying critical body features affecting antenna performance
2. **Physical Phantom:** Used for practical repeatable measurements

Both serve to validate antenna performance under realistic human body presence.

### 2.2 Numerical Phantom Development

#### 2.2.1 3D Model Creation

**Generation Method:**
- Created using open-source Make Human tool
- Provides realistic three-dimensional human body geometry
- Body shape and dimensions based on anthropometric data

**Electromagnetic Modeling:**
- Imported into CST Microwave Studio for electromagnetic analysis
- Surface impedance representing human skin properties added as model attribute

#### 2.2.2 Penetration Depth Consideration

**Frequency-Dependent Penetration Depth:**
- At 28 GHz: 0.92 to 0.95 mm
- Small penetration depth allows simplification to surface impedance model
- Accurate calculation of scattered electromagnetic fields possible with surface model only

**Simulation Method:**
- Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations employed
- Surface integral equation solver in CST Microwave Studio calculates scattered fields
- Integral equation approach enables accurate solution despite complex body geometry

#### 2.2.3 Dual-Stage Simulation Methodology

**Stage 1: Antenna-Phone Equivalent Sources**
- Equivalent near-field sources derived for cuboid sub-volume enclosing hand and mobile phone
- One antenna feed activated sequentially, one at time
- FDTDT simulations performed for each activated feed
- Result: 16 total equivalent near-field sources (for 8-feed array with two polarizations)

**Rationale for Staged Approach:**
- Allows separate treatment of antenna/phone system and human body
- Necessary due to vastly different computational mesh size requirements for small antenna structures versus large body geometry
- Enables efficient simulation of combined system

**Stage 2: Body Scattering Calculation**
- Equivalent field sources used as input
- Surface integral equation solver computes radiated fields with body model included
- Full scattered field pattern calculated in presence of human body

#### 2.2.4 Phone Chassis Representation

**Simplification Used:**
- Mobile phone chassis included within equivalent-source volume
- Represented as simple cuboid structure
- Modeled as perfect electrical conductor (PEC)

#### 2.2.5 Numerical Model Truncation Strategy

**Truncation Decision:**
- Full human body model truncated at hip level (just below hip)
- Reduces computational complexity for both simulation and later physical measurements

**Truncation Validation:**
Comparison of realized antenna gain between full and truncated models:
- For θ < 107°: Mean absolute error < 0.3 dB
- For θ < 140°: Mean absolute error < 0.7 dB
- Error increases for lower elevation angles (toward legs region)

**Justification for Truncation:**
- In practical cellular communication scenario, field radiation toward legs (θ ≥ 150°) of minimal importance
- Radiated electromagnetic fields to legs reflect off ground surface, bounce back to sky
- These reflected fields rarely reach base station receivers
- Therefore truncated model sufficiently accurate for cellular mobile radio evaluation

### 2.3 Physical Phantom - Material Science

#### 2.3.1 Human Skin Electromagnetic Properties

**Skin Thickness:**
- Ranges from 1.3 to 2.9 mm in human body

#### 4.3.4 Sub-array Definition

**Sub-array Structure:**

The 16-port array divided into four processing sub-arrays:

**Sub-array 1:** Four feeds with horizontal polarization (front module)
**Sub-array 2:** Four feeds with vertical polarization (front module)  
**Sub-array 3:** Four feeds with horizontal polarization (back module)
**Sub-array 4:** Four feeds with vertical polarization (back module)

**Rationale:**
- Separate processing enables independent optimization
- Maintains cross-polarization isolation
- Reflects practical phased array receiver structure

#### 4.3.5 Phase Shifter Configuration and Pattern Count

**Phase Shifter Specification:**
- Three-bit phase shifters per array feed
- Each three-bit shifter provides 2³ = 8 possible phase settings
- Phase step resolution: 45° between adjacent settings

**Pattern Generation:**
- Each sub-array: 8 phase settings per feed × 4 feeds = 2⁴ = 16 patterns per feed, but actually:
  - 8 phase settings raised to power of 4 feeds = 8⁴ = 4096 possible combinations
  - Limited to practical patterns: 512 patterns analyzed per sub-array
  - Pattern selection based on 3-bit resolution: (2³)⁴/4 = 512 patterns

**Total Pattern Library:**
- Four sub-arrays × 512 patterns per sub-array = 2048 total synthesized patterns
- Comprehensive coverage of practical beam forming scenarios

#### 4.3.6 Pattern Categories and Overlap

**Pattern Type 1: Clear Main Beams**
- Patterns with well-defined main lobe and controlled side lobes
- Contribute maximum gain in specific directions

**Pattern Type 2: Broad Patterns**
- Patterns without sharp main beams
- Provide coverage in other directions
- Necessary for Maximum Ratio Combining implementation

**Pattern Overlap:**
- 2048 patterns overlap in coverage at many angles
- Overlapping patterns collectively contribute to MRC solution
- All patterns considered relevant for practical operation

#### 4.3.7 Example Synthesized Patterns

Six representative patterns shown in results (out of 2048 total):

| Phase Settings | Characteristics |
|:--|:--|
| [0°, 315°, 180°, 135°] | Main beam contribution |
| [0°, 45°, 315°, 45°] | Main beam contribution |
| [0°, 0°, 180°, 180°] | Main beam contribution |
| [0°, 0°, 315°, 315°] | Broad coverage pattern |
| [0°, 180°, 225°, 135°] | Broad coverage pattern |
| [0°, 90°, 45°, 270°] | Broad coverage pattern |

**Phase Notation:**
- Four values represent phase applied to four feeds within sub-array
- 0° = reference phase (no phase shift)
- Other values relative to reference

### 4.4 Maximum Realized Gains and Spherical Coverage

#### 4.4.1 Spherical Coverage Concept

**Definition:**
Empirical statistics characterizing maximum gains that antenna array can realize for all possible angles of arrival on complete sphere.

**Motivation:**
- Provides comprehensive performance evaluation
- Accounts for all possible user orientations
- Standardized metric in 3GPP standards

#### 4.4.2 Mathematical Formulation

**Maximum Realized Gain at Angle Ω:**

$$\hat{G}(\Omega) = \max_k G_k(\Omega)$$

where:
- Ω represents a specific angle on the sphere
- G_k(Ω) = ||g_k(Ω)||² is the power gain of k-th synthesized pattern (1 ≤ k ≤ 2048)
- g_k(Ω) = [g_θ(Ω) g_φ(Ω)] is the complex gain vector for two field polarizations (vertical and horizontal)
- Maximum over all 2048 patterns identifies best gain at that angle

#### 4.4.3 CDF Representation

**Cumulative Distribution Function:**
- Collection of Ĝ values across all angles Ω
- Characterized by empirical CDF
- CDF(x) = probability that Ĝ < x

**Interpretation:**
- CDF function shows what percentage of solid angles achieve gain less than a given level
- 0.5 probability point indicates median gain
- 0.1 probability point indicates 10th percentile (low-gain directions)

#### 4.4.4 Spherical Sampling Grid

**Uniform Sphere Sampling:**
- Angles Ω sampled uniformly across entire sphere
- Azimuth (φ) angles: More samples near equator, fewer near poles
- Elevation (θ) angles: Uniform distribution

**Benefit:**
- Results independent of coordinate system orientation
- Phone orientation changes do not affect statistics
- Representative of all possible user orientations

#### 4.4.5 Spherical Coverage Statistics

**Standard Metrics:**
- Mean gain across sphere
- Median gain (50th percentile)

- Creates 8 total test cases (2³ = 8 combinations)

**Justification for ±10% Range:**
- Observed manufacturing errors smaller than ±10%
- ±10% represents conservative worst-case scenario
- Accounts for material batch variation

**Sensitivity Analysis Results:**
- Average CDF difference: 0.24 dB
- Standard deviation: 0.21 dB
- **Conclusion:** Material property variations have minor effect on patterns and statistics

#### 4.5.8 Phone Placement Variation - Uncertainty Analysis

- Standard deviation: 0.29 dB
- **Conclusion:** Placement variations within ±2 mm cause <0.4 dB change

#### 4.5.9 Phase Center Misalignment - Uncertainty Analysis

**Geometric Configuration Issue:**
- Phase center of antenna array cannot be aligned with measurement tower rotation axes
- Due to measurement tower design limitations

**Actual Geometry:**
- Phase center to azimuth rotation axis: 0.3 m distance
- Phase center to elevation rotation axis: 0.36 m distance
- Probe antenna to tower rotation axis: 6.1 m distance

**Angular Variation Effect:**
- Phantom rotation causes maximum ±4° angle variation
- In angle at which probe antenna views the AUT
- Probe antenna gain varies with viewing angle

**Probe Antenna Gain Degradation:**
- Maximum gain reduction: 0.6 dB at ±4° off-axis
- Per probe antenna electrical specification
- Results in amplitude measurement uncertainty: ±0.6 dB

#### 4.5.10 Measurement Tower Shadowing

**Shadowed Region:**
- Measurement tower creates shadow in antenna pattern
- Specifically affects angles toward phantom legs: θ > 150°
- Visible in published measurement results

**Impact Assessment:**
- Affects low-elevation angles (toward ground)
- Less critical region for cellular base station communication
- Noted in results interpretation

## ABSTRACT

### Research Context

Implementation of an antenna array on a 5G mobile phone chassis is crucial in ensuring radio link quality, especially at millimeter-waves. However, the ability to design antennas under practical operational conditions involving body effects of a mobile user in a repeatable manner has been lacking.

### Contribution

This paper presents the development of numerical and physical phantoms of a human body for evaluation of mobile handset antennas at 28 GHz.

### Phantom Characteristics

**Numerical Phantom:**

- Used for comparative analysis

**Physical Phantom:**
- Much simpler hexagonal cross-section
- Represents human body for practical testing
- Enables repeatable measurements

### Array Configuration - Co-located Array

The array is formed by placing:
- Two sets of 4-element dual-polarized patch antenna arrays
- Called "two modules"
- Located at two different locations of mobile phone chassis
- Intended to collect maximum energy to single transceiver chain

### Performance Evaluation

Gains of the phased antenna array configuration on mobile phone chassis are numerically and experimentally evaluated.

### Spherical Coverage Analysis

- Realized gain evaluated across entire solid angles
- Experimental statistics agree with numerical simulations
- Demonstrates antenna evaluation method reproduces reality
- Phantom serves repeatable tests of antenna array prototypes at 28 GHz

### Key Achievement

### 1.3 Human Body Effects - Research Gap

Despite increasing relevance of NR FR2:
- Effects of human body on antenna gains and losses have got relatively little attention at NR FR2
- Despite significant studies providing insights into robust mobile phone antenna array configurations
- Clear design guidelines for mobile antenna systems are still missing

### 1.4 Empirical Evaluation Challenges

**Challenges at NR FR2:**

## 2. HUMAN BODY PHANTOMS

### 2.1 Phantom Development Overview

Two types of phantoms developed for different purposes:
- Numerical phantom: Identify influential body parts
- Physical phantom: Practical testing

### 2.2 Numerical Phantom

#### Creation Method

**3D Model Generation:**
- Created using open-source tool Make Human
- Represents realistic human body shape

**Computational Environment:**
- Imported to CST Microwave Studio
- Surface impedance representing skin added as model attribute
- Skin added as attribute of the model

**Electromagnetic Properties:**
- Small penetration depth at 28 GHz: 0.92-0.95 mm
- Surface model allows accurate scattered field calculation with FTDT simulations

**Simulation Method:**
- Integral equation solver in CST Microwave Studio used to calculate scattered fields
- Can handle complex body geometries

#### Simulation Scenario

**Operating Condition:**
- Human holds mobile phone in portrait browsing mode
- Single hand holding configuration

**Hand and Antenna Interaction:**
- Fingers and hand palm do NOT touch antenna elements
- Avoids reducing impedance matching (out of scope of study)
- Ensures antenna element isolation

#### Dual-Step Simulation Approach

**Step 1 - Antenna-Phone Isolation:**
- Derive equivalent near-field sources
- For cuboid sub-volume enclosing hand and mobile phone only
- One feed activated at time
- Obtain 16 equivalent sources using FTDT simulations

**Step 2 - Body Scattering Calculation:**
- Use equivalent field sources to compute radiated fields
- Calculate with body model using surface integral equation solver
- Allows separate simulation of antenna feeds and body
- Necessary due to different mesh size requirements

#### Mobile Phone Representation

**Simplified Model:**
- Mobile phone chassis included inside equivalent-source volume
- Represented as simple cuboid
- Made of perfect electric conductor

#### Numerical Model Truncation

**Truncation Level:**
- Numerical human model truncated just below hip level
- Reduces simulation complexity and measurement complexity

**Validation of Truncation:**
Mean absolute error for realized gain per constant θ pattern cut:
- θ < 107°: Error < 0.3 dB
- θ < 140°: Error < 0.7 dB
- Comparison: Truncated vs. full-sized human models

**Performance Justification:**
- When human holds mobile phone, field radiation to legs (θ ≥ 150°) least important in cellular radios
- Radiated fields bounce from ground, reflect to sky, never reach base station
- Therefore truncated human model sufficiently accurate for cellular mobile radio evaluation

### 2.3 Physical Phantom - Material Design

#### Skin Material Considerations

**Human Skin Characteristics:**
- Skin thickness varies: 1.3 to 2.9 mm
- Thicker than electromagnetic wave penetration depth at 28 GHz
- Therefore only skin needs to be considered in phantom design

**Validation:**
- Gabriel's extrapolated results experimentally verified at higher frequencies
- Verified at 28 GHz

#### Skin Mimicking Material Development

**Reference Material:**
- Created by Chahat et al. at 60 GHz
- Similar material shown to work at lower frequencies

**Material Composition:**
The skin phantom material consists of:
- Deionized water (Main constituent)
- Agar
- Polyethylene-powder
- TX-151

**Material Functions:**

| Component | Function | Justification |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Deionized Water** | Main constituent | Human skin mostly composed of water; determines dispersive behavior |
| **Agar** | Shape retention | Minimal effect on dielectric properties |
| **TX-151** | Increase viscosity | Necessary since agar and polyethylene-powder cannot be mixed directly |
| **Polyethylene-powder** | Adjust permittivity | Decrease real part; adjust imaginary part of permittivity |

#### Skin Material Recipe

Skin mimicking material containing 70 m% water was manufactured according to specifications:

| Ingredient | Mass (g) |
|:--|:--|
| Deionized water | 100 |
| Agar | 3 |
| TX-151 | 4 |
| Polyethylene powder | 36 |

#### Permittivity Measurement

**Measurement Method:**
- Well-established method observing transmission coefficients
- Method elaborated in reference [29]

**Permittivity Results at 28 GHz:**

| Property | Gabriel's Model | Measured Value | Difference |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Real part of permittivity | 16.55 | 16 | -3.3% |
| Conductivity (S/m) | 25.82 | 27 | +4.6% |

**Durability Testing:**
- Permittivity measurements repeated monthly for four months
- Skin material sample kept in airtight container between measurements
- Changes in real and imaginary parts noticeable only after four months
- Conclusion: Material usable up to three months after manufacturing if kept in airtight environment

#### Skin Material Casting Process

**Preparation:**
1. Skin material cast onto flat plates
2. Left for approximately 12 hours
3. Material becomes semi-solid state (solid and flexible at room temperature, liquid when cast)

**Definition of Semi-solid:**
- Material is solid and flexible at room temperature
- Becomes liquid when cast on plate
- Increasing amount of TX-151 and agar makes material harder

**Application to Phantom:**
- Attached to surface of Styrofoam phantom core
- Requires protective plastic film

#### Plastic Film Protection

**Film Material:**
- LD-PE (Low-Density Polyethylene)
- Thickness: 0.1 mm
- Relative permittivity: 2.3

**Film Performance at 28 GHz:**
- Reflection coefficient: -28.4 dB (according to ITU-R P.2040)
- Indicates no effect on reflection coefficient of skin material

#### Skin Layer Thickness Optimization

**Design Thickness:**
- Target biological thickness: 1.5-2 mm
- Practical manufactured thickness: 5 mm
- Reason: Ensures structural durability of skin layer (not easy to manufacture layer as thin as 2 mm)

**Validation of Thickness:**
- Calculated reflection coefficient difference between 5 mm and 1.5 mm thickness: Only 0.14 dB difference
- Conclusion: Negligible effects on electromagnetic wave scattering and reflection
- Ensures durability of phantom while maintaining accuracy

## 4. ANTENNA GAIN EVALUATION

### 4.1 Evaluation Methodology

#### Multi-Stage Approach

**Step 1: Free Space Characterization**
- Radiated far-fields of each antenna feed simulated and measured in free space
- Estimates losses of feed lines and connectors in fabricated antenna array

**Step 2: Loss De-embedding**
- De-embed losses from far-field radiation patterns
- Measured patterns obtained with hexagonal body phantom

**Step 3: Ideal Pattern Synthesis**
- Ideal pattern synthesis applied to element far-field patterns
- Analyzes spherical coverage of realized gains
- Evaluated with and without phantom

**Step 4: Efficacy Evaluation**
- Compare spherical coverage statistics of realized gains
- Between simulations and measurements
- Validates approach effectiveness

#### Data Availability

All simulated and measured patterns available in reference [33].

### 4.2 De-embedding Feed Lines and Connector Losses

#### Motivation for De-embedding

**Simulation vs. Measurement Challenge:**
- Simulations: Can feed antenna elements directly at two feed pins
- Measurements: Require feed lines along with connectors and patch cables
- Neither approach provides direct loss estimates
- Hand soldering introduces different losses to all connectors

#### De-embedding Method

**Loss Estimation Approach:**
- Calculate mean difference between simulated and measured main beams
- For each individual feed port in free space
- Main beams span ±60° in both θ and φ direction

**Loss Representation:**
- Estimated losses have form of complex amplitude
- Applied later to measured beam patterns with hexagonal body phantom

#### Phase Correction Handling

**Phase Correction Rationale:**
- Phase de-embedding can be neglected
- Spherical coverage analysis uses ideal three-bit phase shifters
- Leads to 512 random different phase combination patterns per sub-array
- Best phase combination found without phase de-embedding

#### Loss Estimates Table

| Port | Loss (dB) |
|:--|:--|
| Port 1 | 10.7 |
| Port 2 | 10.4 |
| Port 3 | 10.3 |
| Port 4 | 11.0 |
| Port 5 | 12.4 |
| Port 6 | 12.1 |
| Port 7 | 13.1 |
| Port 8 | 14.4 |

**Loss Pattern:**
- Loss estimates proportional to length of feed lines

#### Free Space Gain Validation

**Representative Ports - Measured Maximum Gains:**
- Port 7: 6.3 dBi
- Port 8: 5.3 dBi

**Representative Ports - Simulated Maximum Gains:**
- Port 7: 6.3 dBi
- Port 8: 5.4 dBi

**Main Beam Agreement:**
- Compensated patterns agree well with simulated ones
- Particularly in main beam direction (θ = ±60°)

**Back Lobe Observation:**
- Back lobe levels slightly higher in compensated patterns than simulations
- Probably caused by simplifications in array models (for feasible simulation time)
- Does not affect main results (maximum realized gain, CDF)

### 4.3 Pattern Synthesis

#### Available Field Data

**Input Data:**
- Simulated and measured polarimetric radiated far-field patterns
- Separately obtained for each feed
- Influenced by scattering from human body

#### Phase Shifting Implementation Scope

**Out of Scope:**
- Implementation of phase shifting parts in pattern synthesis
- Whether fully-digital, analog, or hybrid
- Details of practical phase shifter design

#### Assumed Conditions

**Simplification:**
- Ideal, lossless phase shifting assumed
- Concentrates analysis on antenna-body interaction

#### Weighting Strategy

**Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC):**
- Known to be optimal weighting strategy in single-chain receiver
- Used to calculate weights for ideal pattern synthesis

**Optimization Goal:**
- Maximize signal-to-noise ratio at receiver
- Rather than forming clear main beams

#### Pattern Synthesis Implementation

**Sub-array Definition:**

Step 1: Synthesize patterns of 4 antenna feeds out of 16 available feeds

Step 2: Define four sub-arrays for pattern synthesis:
- Sub-array 1: Four patch antenna feeds radiating horizontally-polarized fields (planar array)
- Sub-array 2: Four feeds for vertical polarization
- Sub-array 3: Related to front module
- Sub-array 4: Related to back module

#### Phase Shifter Configuration

**Ideal Phase Shifter Specification:**
- Three-bit phase shifters
- Lead to 512 different patterns per sub-array

**Total Pattern Count:**
- Four sub-arrays × 512 patterns = 2048 total synthesized pattern realizations

**Pattern Overlap:**
- 2048 synthesized realizations overlap in some directions
- All considered relevant for practical operational environments

#### Synthesized Pattern Types

**Pattern Categories:**
- Patterns showing clear main beams
- Patterns without main beams
- Required to approximate Maximum Ratio Combining

#### Example Patterns

**Presentation:** Six out of 2048 synthesized patterns shown in figures

**Example Specification for φ = 90° cut:**
- First four patterns: Contribute to maximum gain on cut plane
- Last two patterns: Overlap with others on cut plane

**Phase Values Example:**
- [0°, 315°, 180°, 135°]
- [0°, 45°, 315°, 45°]
- [0°, 0°, 180°, 180°]
- [0°, 0°, 315°, 315°]
- [0°, 180°, 225°, 135°]
- [0°, 90°, 45°, 270°]

**Phase Application:**
- Phases given to different antenna elements
- By ideal, lossless phase shifting

#### Spherical Coverage Evaluation

**Approach:**
- Use one of 2048 realizations at time
- Evaluate spherical coverage of realized gains

### 4.4 Maximum Realized Gains and Spherical Coverage

#### Spherical Coverage Definition

**Concept:**
- Empirical statistics of maximum gains that antenna array can realize
- For all possible angles on sphere

#### Mathematical Definition

For angle of interest Ω, maximum realized gain:

$$\hat{G}(\Omega) = \max_k G_k(\Omega)$$

where:
- $G_k(\Omega) = ||g_k(\Omega)||^2$ is power gain of k-th synthesized pattern
- $1 \leq k \leq 2048$
- $g_k(\Omega) = [g_θ(\Omega) \quad g_φ(\Omega)]$ is complex gain vector of two field polarizations

#### CDF Representation

**Statistics Characterization:**
- Collection of $\hat{G}$ over different angles Ω
- Characterized by cumulative distribution function (CDF)
- $CDF(x) = prob(\hat{G} < x)$ where $prob(·)$ derives probability of specified condition

#### Spherical Angle Sampling

**Uniform Sphere Sampling:**
- Angles Ω chosen to be uniform across full sphere
- Number of azimuth angles smaller at higher elevation angles (close to pole)
- More azimuth angles at lower elevation angles (close to horizon)

**Benefit:**
- Resulting spherical coverage independent of mobile phone orientation

- Shows coverage in form of beam

**Coverage Pattern - φ = 90° Cut:**
- Shows E-plane and H-plane coverage

#### Pattern Differences - Measurements vs Simulations

**Area Shadowed by Body:**

Around φ = 270°:
- 7° wider in measurements compared to simulations
- Possibly caused by difference in body phantom width vs numerical human model

**Gain Reduction Around φ = 90° and θ = 135°:**
- Lower gains in measurements than simulations
- May be attributed to antenna misplacement in measurements
- As explained in measurement tower misalignment section

**Gain Near θ = ±180°:**
- Lower measured realized gains than simulated
- Due to measurement tower shadowing

#### Overall Pattern Agreement

**Conclusion:**
- Although some differences observed in cuts
- Measured patterns match simulated patterns well in general

#### Free Space CDF Results

**Finding:**
- Measured spherical coverage CDF matches simulated CDF above 0.7 probability level
- Below 0.7 level: measured starts to have smaller gain values
- At 0.1 probability level: 2.2 dB difference between measured and simulated

**Explanation for Differences:**
- Absorbers added at bottom part of phone chassis during free space measurements
- Eliminate leakage and radiation from connectors
- Absorbers shadow part of sphere analyzed
- Simulations do not include absorbers
- Leads to difference in outage level in CDF

#### With Body Phantom - CDF Results

**Key Finding:**
- Presence of body does NOT affect maximum realized gain of array
- Compared to free space case

**Performance Metric:**
- Array realizes median gain greater than 4.5 dB
- At 0.1 outage level: realized gains below -10 dB
  - Corresponds to directions behind body

**Measured-Simulated Difference:**
- At peak gain: 0.3 dB difference
- At 0.1 level: 3 dB difference

#### Measurement Repeatability

**Repeatability Test:**
- Measurements with body phantom performed twice
- Results: Less than 1 dB difference between two measurements across CDF

**Conclusion:**
- Indicates good repeatability

#### Phantom Appropriateness Conclusion

**Overall Assessment:**
- Good agreement between simulations (numerical human model) and measurements (hexagonal phantom)
- Phantom appropriate for evaluating antenna arrays under human body influence
- In terms of spherical coverage statistics

The permittivity of the skin material was measured using
a well-established method to observe transmission coefﬁcients
of the material elaborated in [29]. Table II shows the real
part of permittivity and conductivity of the skin material at
28 GHz. The real part is 3.3% less and the conductivity is
4.6% more than skin in Gabriel’s model. The permittivity
measurements were repeated monthly for four months to
determine its durability. The skin material sample was kept in
an airtight container between measurements to refrain water
from evaporating. Changes in the real and imaginary parts of
the permittivity were noticeable only after four months. Thus,
this skin material can be used up to three months after the
manufacturing if kept in an airtight environment.
The skin material is cast onto ﬂat plates and left for about
12 hours. Then the material was semi-solid1 and could be

it is in the room temperature and liquid when cast on the plate. Increasing
the amount of TX-151 and agar makes the material harder.

attached to the surface of the Styrofoam phantom core . This
plastic ﬁlm is made of 0.1 mm thick LD-PE, which has a
relative permittivity of 2.3 [30]. Reﬂection coefﬁcient of the
ﬁlm was −28.4 dB at 28 GHz according to ITU-R P.2040 [31],
which indicated that the ﬁlm has no effect on the reﬂection
coefﬁcient of the skin material.
It is not easy to manufacture a skin material layer as thin
as 2 mm. To ensure structural durability of skin layer, its
thickness on the phantom was set to 5 mm. According to
calculation from the ITU-R P.2040, the reﬂection coefﬁcient
of a skin layer with 5 mm thickness differs only 0.14 dB
compared to skin with 1.5 mm thickness. So, we can expect
negligible effects on electromagnetic wave scattering and
reﬂection while ensuring durability of the phantom.

Figure 8 shows azimuth cuts of the realized gain patterns
ports 7 and 8. Dotted lines are measured patterns, dashed lines
are measured patterns with the de-embedding terms added
and solid lines are simulated patterns. As can be seen, the
compensated patterns agree well with the simulated ones in the
main beam direction i.e. θ = ±60◦. Maximum Gains of the
shown measured ports are 6.3 dBi and 5.3 dBi and simulated
maximum gains are 6.3 dBi and 5.4 dBi for port 7 and 8 in Fig.
5, respectively. Back lobe levels are, however, slightly higher
in compensated patterns than in simulations. This difference
is probably caused by simpliﬁcations done to array models
in order to get feasible simulation time. The exact cause of
the difference is out of the scope of this paper. However, this
increase in back lobe patterns does not affect to the result of
this paper, namely the maximum realized gain in Fig. 11 and
the CDF of that.
B. Pattern synthesis
We have now obtained the simulated and measured po-
larimetric radiated far-ﬁeld patterns separately for each feed,
inﬂuenced by scattering from the human body. Implementation
of phase shifting parts in pattern synthesis, whether it is a fully
digital, analog or hybrid, is out of the scope of this paper.
We assumed ideal, lossless phase shifting to concentrate on
antenna-body interaction analysis. We calculate the weight for
ideal pattern synthesis using the maximum ratio combining
(MRC) which is known to be optimal weighting strategy in a
single-chain receiver [34]. The goal is to maximize the signal-
to-noise ratio at the receiver rather than forming clear main
beams. The pattern synthesis is performed in the following
manner.
1) We synthesize patterns of four antenna feeds out of
16 available feeds in the array. Four sub-arrays for
pattern synthesis are deﬁned in array for the purpose.
One sub-array is a group of four patch antenna feeds
radiating horizontally-polarized ﬁelds in a planar array
(see Fig. 5), while the other is the group of four feeds
for vertical polarization.
2) The weights for synthesizing patterns applied at each
antenna feed are deﬁned by ideal three-bit phase shifters,
leading to 512 different patterns for each sub-array. As
there are 4 sub-arrays, the total number of synthesized
pattern realizations for an array conﬁguration is 2048.
The 2048 synthesized realizations of patterns overlap in
some directions. We consider all of them relevant for the
operation of the antenna array in practical operational
environments. Not only synthesized patterns showing
clear main beams, but also those without main beams
are required to approximate the MRC. As examples, six
out of 2048 synthesized patterns are shown in Fig. 9 for
φ = 90◦cut. The ﬁrst four mentioned patterns contribute
to the maximum gain on this cut plane, while the last
two beams overlap with others on this cut plane. We
use one of the 2048 realizations at a time for spherical
coverage evaluation of the realized gains.
C. Maximum Realized Gains and Spherical Coverage
Spherical coverage is the empirical statistics of maximum
gains that an antenna array can realize for all possible angles
on a sphere. For an angle of interest Ω, the maximum realized
gain of the array is deﬁned by
ˆG(Ω) = max
k
Gk(Ω),

where Gk(Ω) = ||gk(Ω)||2 is the power gain of k-th syn-
thesized patterns of an array, 1 ≤k ≤2048 in our case;

ﬁeld polarizations. Collection of ˆG over different angles Ωare

erence between
simulated and measured main beams for each individual feed
port in free space. The main beams span across ±60◦in
both θ and φ direction. The estimated losses have a form of
complex amplitude and are later applied to the measured beam
patterns with the hexagonal body phantom. Phase correction
can be neglected because for spherical coverage analysis we
deﬁned antenna weights by ideal three-bit phase shifters,
leading to 512 random different phase combination patterns for
each sub-array. From those 512 phase combination patterns,
we will ﬁnd the best phase combination without phase de-

is less than 1 dB difference between these two measurements
across the CDF, which indicates good repeatability. Given
the agreement between simulations using numerical human
model and measurements using the hexagonal cross-sectioned
body phantom, it is possible to conclude that the phantom is
appropriate for evaluating antenna arrays under inﬂuence of a
human body in terms of spherical coverage statistics.

V. CONCLUSION
This paper presented the design and manufacturing of a
hexagonal human body phantom for repeatable tests of mobile
phone antenna arrays at 28 GHz. Relevant test array was
implemented on a mobile phone sized chassis and gains of it
were evaluated in free space and when it was held by a hand
palm of a body phantom. Measured and simulated maximum
gain matches well, according to the spherical coverage CDF as
an evaluation metric. We thereby demonstrated suitability of
our antenna model in numerical simulations and physical body
phantom design that has a simpliﬁed shape compared to actual
human bodies. Proper identiﬁca

a difference in
the width of the body phantom compared to the numerical
human model. Also, the realized gain in Fig. 11(a) around
φ = 90◦, and in Fig. 11(b) around θ = 135◦is lower in the
measurements than in simulations. This may be attributed to
the antenna misplacement in the measurements explained in
the previous paragraph. Finally, the measured realized gains
near θ = ±180◦in Fig. 11(b) are lower than in the simulations
due to the measurement tower shadowing those angular ranges.
Although some differences can be seen from there cuts, the
measured patterns match well in general with the simulated
ones
1) Free space: The CDF of the maximum realized gains in
free space across 301 angles covering the entire sphere was
calculated according to [18] as shown in Fig. 12(a). It shows
that the measured spherical coverage CDF of the array matches
with simulated one above 0.7 probability level. Below this
level, the measured starts to get smaller gain values and at 0.1
probability level there is 2.2 dB difference between measured
and simulated results. Differences in the outage level can be
explained by the fact that absorbers were added, at the bottom
part of the phone chassis, during the free space measurements
to eliminate the leakage and radiation from the connectors.
These absorbers shadows part of the sphere analyzed in the

MOBILE PHONE CHASSIS
A. Antenna Element
In this work we decided to use a rectangular stacked patch
as an antenna element intended for a mobile phone, which is
detailed in [18]. The patch is designed so that it realizes a
wide enough bandwidth for radio systems operating around
28 GHz. The Relative permittivity and dissipation factor of
the substrate is 3.6 and 0.004, respectively, which are available
from Rogers as RO4450B with 0.505 and 0.101 mm thickness.
Horizontal dimensions of the antenna element are shown in
Fig. 4(a) and the feed structure on the backside is illustrated
in Fig. 4(b). Two microstrip feed lines are implemented on
0.101 mm-thick RO4450B substrate on the opposite side of the
ground plane of the patch antennas. The total thickness of the
antenna integrated with the feed lines is 0.775 mm. Feed lines
are galvanically connected to the patch through microvias. Two
feeds are needed for each patch antenna element as it covers
the two orthogonal polarizations.

second one at the top-right corner on the back side. These
two modules are designed to cover different parts of the space
and collect the as much energy to the transceiver since the
patch antenna will not radiate to the backside.
C. Fabrication of the Array
The array is placed on a phone-sized structure, with the
dimensions of 150 × 75 × 8 mm. The printed circuit board
(PCB) was designed to be 150×75 mm. We want to minimize
the possible effect of the connectors on the radiation of the
array. We line up all eight connectors at the bottom side of the
phone chassis and design the microstrip feed lines between the
connectors at the bottom and the antenna elements at the top
corner of the PCB. As the front and back sides of the antenna
array in the phone chassis are symmetrical, we manufactured
only one side of the phone and in the measurements, we
ﬂipped the chassis around to realize the other module. Having
only one module on the phone chassis ensures enough space
for the eight connectors. The feed line

the inner parts of the phantom is Styrofoam, and a wooden
pole in the center connects the head to the torso. Styrofoam
is chosen because it is light, unyielding and is relatively
easy to shape. The skin material is added on all surfaces
of the Styrofoam structure except for the bottom where the
mechanical connection to the measurement tower is imple-
mented. Dimensions of the torso and head of the phantom
are 330 × 250 × 720 mm and 180 × 150 × 220 mm (length,
width, height), respectively. The hand palm is a rectangular
box with dimensions 190 × 50 × 85 mm and the immersion is

enetration depth
of 0.92−0.95 mm [24] at 28 GHz, the surface model allows us
to calculate scattered ﬁelds of antennas accurately with FTDT
simulations. The integral equation solver in CST Microwave
Studio was used to calculate the scattered ﬁelds [17]. The sim-
ulation covered the case when a human holds a mobile phone
in portrait browsing mode using a single hand. In our study,
ﬁngers and hand palm do not touch any antenna elements,
avoiding the case of reducing the impedance matching, which
is not in the scope of this study. First, we derive equivalent
near-ﬁeld sources for a cuboid sub-volume enclosing only
the hand and the mobile phone, with one feed activated at
a time, hence we obtain sixteen equivalent sources using
FTDT simulations. These equivalent ﬁeld sources are used
to compute the radiated ﬁelds with the body model using
the surface integral equation solver. The use of equivalent
ﬁeld sources allows us to simulate the antenna feeds and
body separately, which usually is necessary due to the very
different scales of mesh sizes required. When solving the
integral equations with the equivalent near-ﬁeld sources of
antenna elements, the mobile phone chassis is included inside
the equivalent-source volume, but as a simple cuboid as a
cuboid made of a perfect electric conductor.

compensated patterns agree well with the simulated ones in the

shown measured ports are 6.3 dBi and 5.3 dBi and simulated
maximum gains are 6.3 dBi and 5.4 dBi for port 7 and 8 in Fig.
5, respectively. Back lobe levels are, however, slightly higher
in compensated patterns than in simulations. This difference
is probably caused by simpliﬁcations done to array models
in order to get feasible simulation time. The exact cause of
the difference is out of the scope of this paper. However, this
increase in back lobe patterns does not affect to the result of
this paper, namely the maximum realized gain in Fig. 11 and
the CDF of that.
B. Pattern synthesis
We have now obtained the simulated and measured po-
larimetric radiated far-ﬁeld patterns separately for each feed,
inﬂuenced by scattering from the human body. Implementation
of phase shifting parts in pattern synthesis, whether it is a fully
digital, analog or hybrid, is out of the scope of this paper.
We assumed ideal, lossless phase shifting to concentrate on
antenna-body interaction analysis. We calculate the weight for
ideal pattern synthesis using the maximum ratio combining
(MRC) which is known to be optimal weighting strategy in a
single-chain receiver [34]. The goal is to maximize the signal-
to-noise ratio at the receiver rather than forming clear main
beams. The pattern synthesis is performed in the following
manner.

can be neglected because for spherical coverage analysis we
deﬁned antenna weights by ideal three-bit phase shifters,
leading to 512 random different phase combination patterns for
each sub-array. From those 512 phase combination patterns,
we will ﬁnd the best phase combination without phase de-
embedding. Table III shows implementation-loss estimates for
the manufactured array where port numbers are same as in
Fig. 5. The loss estimates are proportional to the length of the
feed lines.

characterized by its cumulative distribution function (CDF) for
example as CDF(x) = prob( ˆG < x) where prob(·) derives
a probability of the condition speciﬁed in (·).
When deriving the spherical coverage statistics, the angles
Ωare chosen to be uniform across the full sphere, so that
the number of azimuth angles are smaller at higher elevation
angles close to the pole than at lower elevation angles close to
the horizon of the sphere. The uniform grid over the full sphere
makes sure that the resulting spherical coverage is independent
of the orientation of the mobile phone [35].
D. Measurement Setup and Error Estimation
The measurements in free space and with the hexagonal
body phantom were performed in the fully anechoic chamber
in Aalto University built by ASYSOL. The measurement setup
in the chamber consists of a VNA, a probe antenna, and two
antenna towers, one for the probe antenna and the other for
the AUT. The AUT can be rotated around two axes such that
the full 3-D radiation pattern is recorded in one measurement
session. The separation between the two towers is 6 m. The
phantom is attached from its bottom end to the measurement
tower, as shown in Fig. 10, and the phantom is therefore
horizontally oriented with respect to the ground of the fully
anechoic chamber. This way the shadowing caused by the
tower happens in the direction of the legs, which is of relatively
less importance in cellular radios as expl
