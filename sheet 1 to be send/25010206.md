## Abstract (as in paper)

```text
This paper presents the design and comprehensive measurements of a high-performance 8-element linear array and a com- pact high-gain 32-element planar antenna array covering the n257 (26.5–29.5 GHz) FR-2 millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. First, an 8-element series-fed linear array is designed with a fan-shaped pattern for 5G point-to-multipoint connectivity. Then, a 4-way corporate- series feed network is designed for a high-gain 32-element compact and directive array for point-to-point mmWave connectivity. Com- prehensive over-the-air (OTA) measurements are conducted using a state-of-the-art compact antenna test range (CATR) system, enabling precise characterization of radiation patterns across a 180◦span in the azimuth and elevation planes. The planar array achieves a peak measured gain of 18.45 dBi at 28.5 GHz, with half-power beamwidths ranging 11◦–13◦(wide axis) and 23◦–27◦(narrow axis) across the band of interest. The sidelobe levels are below −10 dB in the desired band of interest. The measured results match well with the simula- tion results. The designed antenna array is applicable to various emerging 5G and beyond mmWave applications such as high data rate mmWave wireless backhaul, mmWave near-field focusing, high-resolution indoor radar systems, 28 GHz Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) as well as the characterization of mmWave path loss and channel sounding in diverse indoor environments.

A conceptual illustration of P2P and P2MP mmWave communication operation. mmWave bands, compact antenna arrays offer high directionality and beamforming gain, essential for directing the antenna’s radiation pattern toward the desired user, thus improving network performance and connectivity. Another critical aspect of mmWave antennas and devices is their measurements. Given the stringent requirements for high-resolution measurements and the sensitivity of mmWave frequencies to environmental factors, a compact antenna test range (CATR) measurement system offers a controlled and efficient solution for far-field testing in a compact space. This method ensures precise measurement of critical parameters such as gain, radiation patterns, and beam-steering capabilities, which are vital for validating the design and functionality of mmWave antenna arrays. Compared with direct farfield method, CATR can significantly reduce the system’s path loss [28], making it the most fitting and appealing test environment for mmWave applications such as beamforming antenna arrays and devices [29–33], 5G base station evaluations [34], as well as mmWave channel-sounding [35]. In this paper, we address these challenges and present the design, implementation, and detailed measurement of a compact and high-directivity 28 GHz FR-2 planar microstrip antenna array, featuring a connectorized solution. The proposed antenna simplifies the design process by avoiding any of the complex features such as inset cuts, slots, vias, and parasitic patches, resulting in ultra-low-cost fabrication and seamless compatibility with standard RF equipment without compromising performance. The design is optimized for enhanced gain, matched bandwidth, compact size, and high radiation efficiency, aiming to boost 5G network performance through reliable and consistent operation. The 8-element linear array produces a fan-beam radiation pattern, making it ideal for P2MP mmWave applications. The 32-element planar array provides a narrow beam with high gain, covering the n257 5G band (26.5–29.5 GHz), making it suitable for point-to-point (P2P) connectivity. The array employs a solderless edge-fed RF feed mechanism, which enhances reusability and offers a simple, cost-effective feeding solution. This approach minimizes losses typically associated with soldered connections at mmWave frequencies and reduces complexity compared to other feeding techniques. Additionally, the edge-launched microstrip feed ensures seamless integration with mmWave connectorized systems and hence simplifies device characterization, supporting robust and efficient deployment in advanced mmWave communication systems. In addition, the proposed antenna serves as a viable and costeffective alternative to expensive mmWave horn antennas, offering comparable high-gain performance and directional radiation characteristics at a fraction of the cost. Unlike horn antennas, which are bulky, costly, and often challenging to integrate into compact systems, the presented planar microstrip array is lightweight, low-profile, and easy to fabricate, making it suitable for mass production and practical deployment in mmWave licensed 5G networks. Further, we elucidate the comprehensive radiation pattern and gain measurements of the antenna array using Rohde & Schwarz (R&S) ATS800B® CATR setup. Furthermore, the detailed measurement methodology, covering gain, radiation patterns, and beamwidth, demonstrates the reliability of the design and offers valuable insights into OTA mmWave antenna evaluation processes, facilitating robust antenna performance validation for 5G and beyond technologies. This is a significant reduction in distance compared to the standard antenna test configuration, which typically requires a minimum distance of 2D2/λ to achieve the same size test region. These benefits encompass the ability to directly evaluate far-field attributes of diverse antenna array configurations across a broad frequency spectrum, within a confined testing space. The proposed antenna design and measurement procedure offer valuable insights for practical OTA mmWave antenna array evaluations, encompassing radiation pattern analysis and realized gain measurements, catering to a wide range of mmWave applications. 2.

Initially, a patch antenna element is designed on the resonance band of 28 GHz. Although a single patch antenna is inherently narrowband, the collective response of multiple resonances from various series-fed patch elements combines to form a wideband impedance bandwidth [36]. Then, more patch elements were added to the first element in a series-fed topology, and reflection bandwidth was analyzed. The design evolution is illustrated in Fig. 3(a) along with results of −10 dB impedance bandwidth. In this approach, the widths and lengths are analytically calculated and tuned to achieve a linear array of patches that radiate with the desired amplitudes and phases around the 28 GHz band. A small tapering is applied to the width of the first patch element to further fine-tune the −10 dB impedance bandwidth. The patch elements are spaced at a distance of approximately λ0/2 (where λ0 is the free space wavelength at 28 GHz) to ensure optimal performance and minimize mutual coupling. The design initially ran through an extensive analytical and simulation process for its critical parameters such as the length and width of the patch antennas, main feed width, and inter-element length. For the design evolution steps of Fig. 2(a), the width (W) and length (L) of the microstrip patch element at 28 GHz were calculated using standard patch antenna equations as [37]: W = c 2fr √ 2 εr + 1 (1) L = c 2fr√εeff −2∆L (2) Here, fr is the desired operational frequency, c the speed of light, εr the relative permittivity of the substrate, εeff the effective relative permittivity of the substrate, h the thickness of the substrate, and ∆L the extended length of the patch that accounts for the fringing effect and depends on the dielectric constant, width, and height of the substrate. The effective permittivity and extended length are calculated as: εeff = εr + 1 2 + εr −1 2 [ 1 + 12 h W ]−1 2 (3) ∆L = 0.412h (εeff + 0.3) ( W h + 0.264 ) (εeff −0.258) ( W h + 0.8 ) (4) At mmWave frequencies, the edge-launched feed offers easy integration and facilitates straightforward antenna measurements. The width of the main feed line was matched to 50 Ω (Z0) calculated using (5) and then further fine-tuned to the optimized value of 0.623 mm. wf = 7.48 × H eZ0 √ (ϵr+1.41) 87 −(1.25 × mt) (5) An extensive parametric sweep was applied during the design evolution to the width of patch elements, as well as to the width and length of the series-connected feed lines. The lengths and widths of the whole linear array were collectively fine-tuned to achieve a −10 dB impedance bandwidth of at least 3 GHz around 28 GHz, thereby covering the 26.5–29.5 GHz band with the desired radiation pattern and gain characteristics, ensuring robust performance for mmWave applications. It is worth mentioning here that the inter-element gap in this series-fed linear array has a significant impact on the input impedance and overall antenna performance, as illustrated in Fig. 2(b). During the design process, we thoroughly investigated the effect of varying the inter-element gap (by keeping the width of patches constant) on key performance parameters such as impedance matching, gain, and efficiency. The gap defines the electrical length of the whole linear array and governs the progressive phase shifts between array elements. Hence, the phase constant can change accordingly which has an impact on the input impedance as well as the radiation pattern (particularly beam-squint) of the array. The optimal gap value was fine-tuned to be 2.82 mm, which provided the finest trade-off between these factors in this design. The dimensions of the fine-tuned linear array are shown in Fig. 2(c). To achieve a compact planar array form factor, a 4-channel equal power divider is designed as shown in Fig. 2(d). The 4-way feed network is designed with appropriate impedance matching to ensure efficient power distribution to each element. The edges of the power divider are chamfered to reduce the spurious emissions through the corner. The interelement spacing (g) between the arms of the parallel feed network (and thus between the center of antenna elements) is set as 5.34 mm (λ0/2) to minimize the mutual coupling as much as possible (here λ0 is 76 www.jpier.org

FULL-WAVE SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS As shown in Fig. 3(a), the −10 dB impedance bandwidth of both linear and planar arrays covers 26.5–29.5 GHz (n257 FR2 mmWave band). The simulated peak realized gain of linear is 14.45 dBi at 29 GHz, whereas for the planar array it is 18.5 dBi at 28.5 GHz, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The variation in gain is within 1.5 dB for the planar array in the band of interest. The radiation efficiency is within 83% to 85.7% for linear array and 80.3% to 85.22% for the planar array. The total efficiency is above 81.47% for the linear array and above 80% for the planar array within 26.5 GHz to 28 GHz. It is important to mention that the consistency in the magnitude and phase of the transmission coefficients of a power divider is crucial for the reliable transmission of data packets for the accurate delivery of signals to the nodes of the 5G access network. Note that for a 4-port power divider, ideally 1/4th of power should reach each output port, which is equivalent to −6 dB. The insertion loss of the designed power divider (i.e., the magnitude of transmission coefficients S21, S31, S41, and S51) is within −6.68 to −6.56 dB, whereas the reflection coefficient (|S11|) is maintained well below −17 dB in the whole band of interest. The magnitude of reflection (S11) and transmission coefficients is shown in Fig. 4(a), while the phase response of the transmission coefficients is shown in Fig. 4(b). With the reference antenna orientation as of Fig. 5(a), the linear array provides a fan-shaped radiation pattern with wider half-power beamwidth (HPBW) ranging between 70◦and 85◦ in the azimuth (x-z) plane and narrow HPBW in the elevation (y-z) plane ranging between 11.8◦to 16◦. The HPBW of the planar array in the x-z plane varies between 23◦and 28◦, whereas in the y-z plane it varies between 10◦and 13.2◦, within the band of interest. A more directive beam is obtained from planar array due to planar geometry and higher number of radiating elements. The sidelobe levels are well below −10 dB. The cross-polarization (X-pol) levels are below −20 dB for both arrays. The 3-D radiation patterns for both arrays are presented in Fig. 5(a). A 3-D waterfall plot of the planar array in the elevation plane is illustrated in Fig. 5(b). Note that the fan-shaped radiation pattern is desirable for multi-point coverage such as in Internet of Things (IoT) and P2MP 5G coverage, whereas a narrow directive beam is desirable for P2P high data rate mmWave links. 4. PROTOTYPE FABRICATION AND OTA RADIATION PATTERN AND GAIN MEASUREMENTS ON CATR The prototypes of both antenna arrays were fabricated using an LPKF milling machine. The measurement setup for the reflection coefficient of both arrays is shown in Fig. 6. The measured results match well with the simulated response, as shown in Fig. 7. Some discrepancies are due to fabrication tolerance, surface roughness, and probable variation in the actual dielectric constant at the mmWave band. The contemporary 5G and beyond applications necessitate a balance of performance, simplicity of fabrication, and integration capabilities, for which microstrip antenna arrays are a prominent candidate. In particular, 5G new radio in mmWave bands necessitates the radiation performance assessments through over-the-air (OTA) testing, rather than conventional conducted methods [38, 39]. This is because, at mmWave frequencies, the antenna size predominantly influences the 77 www.jpier.org

Consequently, for larger mmWave antenna arrays, the far-field distance increases in proportion to the square of the antenna size along with a significant increase in path loss [33]. This renders direct far-field measurements impractical for larger antenna arrays. Furthermore, mmWave antennas are usually integrated with RF frontends, and thus lack of accessibility to the individual antenna connectors renders conventional testing methods impractical [33, 34]. To put this into physical context, consider an mmWave antenna array with a maximum dimension of 15 cm. At 28 GHz, a minimum separation of 4.2 meters would be necessary for its far-field testing. However, this extended measurement distance would result in a substantial free-space path loss about 73.9 dB, posing challenges for a system with a restricted dynamic range. Hence, due to the deterrent effects of conventional direct far-field measurement methods for large mmWave arrays and devices, assessing the performance of mmWave devices for 5G and beyond necessitates an alternative measurement approach, such as OTA indirect test methods [28]. CATR is one of the 3GPP-approved [40] indirect far-field test methods, as demonstrated in Fig. 8. In this work, we utilized the R&S® ATS800B CATR benchtop setup, as shown in Fig. 9. The CATR leverages the optical collimation attributes of a parabolic reflector to transform the spherical wavefront originating from the feed antenna into a planar wave at a very short distance towards the Antenna Under Test (AUT). This process effectively achieves a far-field region at a relatively shorter distance. The limited spatial region where the collimated wave directed by the reflector generates uniform plane waves is known as quiet zone (QZ). This zone is situated much closer to the reflector than the far-field distance of the feed antenna alone. The measurement setup includes an ultra-wideband dual polarized transmit (Tx) Vivaldi antenna which emits a spherical wave positioned at the focal 78 www.jpier.org

(a) Linear array pattern with wider beamwidth. (b) Planar array pattern with narrow beamwidth. The radiation pattern was measured at three different frequencies, i.e., 27, 28, and 29 GHz. The measurement setup is shown in Fig. 10. The AUT was first mounted on the positioner (connected to port 2 of the VNA), and S21 was analyzed for a CW signal of 27 GHz. Since we utilized only one polarization of the Tx antenna at a time, it is important to ensure that the value of S21 is optimized for maximum performance before starting the measurement. This can be easily verified by testing each cable of the dual-polarized Tx antenna individually to determine which configuration yields the highest S21 value. This configuration would mean that the polarization of the Tx antenna and AUT match (i.e., co-pol case). The X-pol case was obtained by swapping the cable of the Tx antenna. Otherwise, it can also be obtained by simply rotating either of the Tx or Rx antenna by 90◦and performing the same set of measurements. The dynamic range of the CATR system was around 35 dB, which was sufficient to measure the radiation patterns and null depths. First, AUT was mounted vertically on the rotator. As shown in Fig. 10, this orientation of the antenna provided wider HPBW, and thus it can be referred to as x-z cut (or phi 0◦of CST) simulations. The measured x-z patterns of linear and planar arrays at different frequency points are shown in Fig. 11. One of the limitations of the presented CATR system is having only one degree of freedom for the azimuth rotation of the positioner. When measuring antenna arrays, it is required to measure both azimuth and elevation patterns to describe the radiation profile of mmWave antenna array accurately. For instance, for the fan-beam pattern of a linear array, the azimuth plane has a wider HPBW while the elevational plane has a narrower HPBW. To overcome this measurement limitation with a cost-effective solution and to measure the radiation pattern in the orthogonal plane, we utilized a 2.4 mm standard right angle to rotate the AUT by 90◦. With this approach, the elevational plane pattern (which in this case matches to phi 90◦cut of CST simulations) can be measured over a complete 180◦by simply rotating the AUT along the horizon, as demonstrated in Fig. 10. However, it is important to mention that while AUT is rotated to 90◦(while using a right angle adapter), the Tx cable should also be switched 80 www.jpier.org

FULL-WAVE SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS As shown in Fig. 3(a), the −10 dB impedance bandwidth of both linear and planar arrays covers 26.5–29.5 GHz (n257 FR2 mmWave band). The simulated peak realized gain of linear is 14.45 dBi at 29 GHz, whereas for the planar array it is 18.5 dBi at 28.5 GHz, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The variation in gain is within 1.5 dB for the planar array in the band of interest. The radiation efficiency is within 83% to 85.7% for linear array and 80.3% to 85.22% for the planar array. The total efficiency is above 81.47% for the linear array and above 80% for the planar array within 26.5 GHz to 28 GHz. It is important to mention that the consistency in the magnitude and phase of the transmission coefficients of a power divider is crucial for the reliable transmission of data packets for the accurate delivery of signals to the nodes of the 5G access network. Note that for a 4-port power divider, ideally 1/4th of power should reach each output port, which is equivalent to −6 dB. The insertion loss of the designed power divider (i.e., the magnitude of transmission coefficients S21, S31, S41, and S51) is within −6.68 to −6.56 dB, whereas the reflection coefficient (|S11|) is maintained well below −17 dB in the whole band of interest. The magnitude of reflection (S11) and transmission coefficients is shown in Fig. 4(a), while the phase response of the transmission coefficients is shown in Fig. 4(b). With the reference antenna orientation as of Fig. 5(a), the linear array provides a fan-shaped radiation pattern with wider half-power beamwidth (HPBW) ranging between 70◦and 85◦ in the azimuth (x-z) plane and narrow HPBW in the elevation (y-z) plane ranging between 11.8◦to 16◦. The HPBW of the planar array in the x-z plane varies between 23◦and 28◦, whereas in the y-z plane it varies between 10◦and 13.2◦, within the band of interest. A more directive beam is obtained from planar array due to planar geometry and higher number of radiating elements. The sidelobe levels are well below −10 dB. The cross-polarization (X-pol) levels are below −20 dB for both arrays. The 3-D radiation patterns for both arrays are presented in Fig. 5(a). A 3-D waterfall plot of the planar array in the elevation plane is illustrated in Fig. 5(b). Note that the fan-shaped radiation pattern is desirable for multi-point coverage such as in Internet of Things (IoT) and P2MP 5G coverage, whereas a narrow directive beam is desirable for P2P high data rate mmWave links. 4. PROTOTYPE FABRICATION AND OTA RADIATION PATTERN AND GAIN MEASUREMENTS ON CATR The prototypes of both antenna arrays were fabricated using an LPKF milling machine. The measurement setup for the reflection coefficient of both arrays is shown in Fig. 6. The measured results match well with the simulated response, as shown in Fig. 7. Some discrepancies are due to fabrication tolerance, surface roughness, and probable variation in the actual dielectric constant at the mmWave band. The contemporary 5G and beyond applications necessitate a balance of performance, simplicity of fabrication, and integration capabilities, for which microstrip antenna arrays are a prominent candidate. In particular, 5G new radio in mmWave bands necessitates the radiation performance assessments through over-the-air (OTA) testing, rather than conventional conducted methods [38, 39]. This is because, at mmWave frequencies, the antenna size predominantly influences the 77 www.jpier.org

SIS
As shown in Fig. 3(a), the −10 dB impedance bandwidth of
both linear and planar arrays covers 26.5–29.5 GHz (n257 FR-
2 mmWave band). The simulated peak realized gain of linear is
14.45 dBi at 29 GHz, whereas for the planar array it is 18.5 dBi
at 28.5 GHz, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The variation
in gain is within 1.5 dB for the planar array in the band of inter-
est. The radiation efficiency is within 83% to 85.7% for linear
array and 80.3% to 85.22% for the planar array. The total effi-
ciency is above 81.47% for the linear array and above 80% for
the planar array within 26.5 GHz to 28 GHz.
It is important to mention that the consistency in the mag-
nitude and phase of the transmission coefficients of a power
divider is crucial for the reliable transmission of data packets
for the accurate delivery of signals to the nodes of the 5G ac-
cess network. Note that for a 4-port power divider, ideally 1/4th
of power should reach each output port, which is equivalent to
−6 dB. The insertion loss of the designed power divider (i.e.,

S51) is within −6.68 to −6.56 dB, whereas the reflection co-
efficient (|S11|) is maintained well below −17 dB in the whole
band of interest. The magnitude of reflection (S11) and trans-
mission coefficients is shown in Fig. 4(a), while the phase re-
sponse of the transmission coefficients is shown in Fig. 4(b).
With the reference antenna orientation as of Fig. 5(a), the
linear array provides a fan-shaped radiation pattern with wider
half-power beamwidth (HPBW) ranging between 70◦and 85◦
in the azimuth (x-z) plane and narrow HPBW in the eleva-
tion (y-z) plane ranging between 11.8◦to 16◦. The HPBW of
the planar array in the x-z plane varies between 23◦and 28◦,
whereas in the y-z plane it varies between 10◦and 13.2◦, within
the band of interest. A more directive beam is obtained from
planar array due to planar geometry and higher number of radi-
ating elements. The sidelobe levels are well below −10 dB. The
cross-polarization (X-pol) levels are below −20 dB for both ar-
rays. The 3-D radiation patterns for both arrays are presented
in Fig. 5(a). A 3-D waterfall plot of the planar array in the ele-
vation plane is illustrated in Fig. 5(b). Note that

## Simulation Results and Performance Metrics

3. FULL-WAVE SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALY-
SIS
As shown in Fig. 3(a), the −10 dB impedance bandwidth of
both linear and planar arrays covers 26.5–29.5 GHz (n257 FR-
2 mmWave band). The simulated peak realized gain of linear is
14.45 dBi at 29 GHz, whereas for the planar array it is 18.5 dBi
at 28.5 GHz, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The variation
in gain is within 1.5 dB for the planar array in the band of inter-
est. The radiation efficiency is within 83% to 85.7% for linear
array and 80.3% to 85.22% for the planar array. The total effi-
ciency is above 81.47% for the linear array and above 80% for
the planar array within 26.5 GHz to 28 GHz.
It is important to mention that the consistency in the mag-
nitude and phase of the transmission coefficients of a power
divider is crucial for the reliable transmission of data packets
for the accurate delivery of signals to the nodes of the 5G ac-
cess network. Note that for a 4-port power divider, ideally 1/4th
of power should reach each output port, which is equivalent to
−6 dB. The insertion loss of the designed power divider (i.e.,
the magnitude of transmission coefficients S21, S31, S41, and
S51) is within −6.68 to −6.56 dB, whereas the reflection co-
efficient (|S11|) is maintained well below −17 dB in the whole
band of interest. The magnitude of reflection (S11) and trans-
mission coefficients is shown in Fig. 4(a), while the phase re-
sponse of the transmission coefficients is shown in Fig. 4(b).
With the reference antenna orientation as of Fig. 5(a), the
linear array provides a fan-shaped radiation pattern with wider
half-power beamwidth (HPBW) ranging between 70◦and 85◦
in the azimuth (x-z) plane and narrow HPBW in the eleva-
tion (y-z) plane ranging between 11.8◦to 16◦. The HPBW of
the planar array in the x-z plane varies between 23◦and 28◦,
whereas in the y-z plane it varies between 10◦and 13.2◦, within
the band of interest. A more directive beam is obtained from
planar array due to planar geometry and higher number of radi-
ating elements. The sidelobe levels are well below −10 dB. The
cross-polarization (X-pol) levels are below −20 dB for both ar-
rays. The 3-D radiation patterns for both arrays are presented
in Fig. 5(a). A 3-D waterfall plot of the planar array in the ele-
vation plane is illustrated in Fig. 5(b). Note that the fan-shaped
radiation pattern is desirable for multi-point coverage such as in
Internet of Things (IoT) and P2MP 5G coverage, whereas a nar-
row directive beam is desirable for P2P high data rate mmWave
links.

4. PROTOTYPE FABRICATION AND OTA RADIATION
PATTERN AND GAIN MEASUREMENTS ON CATR
The prototypes of both antenna arrays were fabricated using an
LPKF milling machine. The measurement setup for the reflec-
tion coefficient of both arrays is shown in Fig. 6. The mea-
sured results match well with the simulated response, as shown
in Fig. 7. Some discrepancies are due to fabrication tolerance,
surface roughness, and probable variation in the actual dielec-
tric constant at the mmWave band.
The contemporary 5G and beyond applications necessitate
a balance of performance, simplicity of fabrication, and inte-
gration capabilities, for which microstrip antenna arrays are a
prominent candidate. In particular, 5G new radio in mmWave
bands necessitates the radiation performance assessments
through over-the-air (OTA) testing, rather than conventional
conducted methods [38, 39].
This is because, at mmWave
frequencies, the antenna size predominantly influences the

far-field distance. Consequently, for larger mmWave antenna
arrays, the far-field distance increases in proportion to the
square of the antenna size along with a significant increase
in path loss [33]. This renders direct far-field measurements
impractical for larger antenna arrays. Furthermore, mmWave
antennas are usually integrated with RF frontends, and thus
lack of accessibility to the individual antenna connectors ren-
ders conventional testing methods impractical [33, 34]. To put
this into physical context, consider an mmWave antenna array
with a maximum dimension of 15 cm. At 28 GHz, a minimum
separation of 4.2 meters would be necessary for its far-field
testing. However, this extended measurement distance would
result in a substantial free-space path loss about 73.9 dB,
posing challenges for a system with a restricted dynamic range.
Hence, due to the deterrent effects of conventional direct
far-field measurement methods for large mmWave arrays
and devices, assessing the performance of mmWave devices
for 5G and beyond necessitates an alternative measurement
approach, such as OTA indirect test methods [28]. CATR is
one of the 3GPP-approved [40] indirect far-field test methods,
as demonstrated in Fig. 8.
In this work, we utilized the R&S® ATS800B CATR bench-
top setup, as shown in Fig. 9. The CATR leverages the optical
collimation attributes of a parabolic reflector to transform the
spherical wavefront originating from the feed antenna into a
planar wave at a very short distance towards the Antenna Un-
der Test (AUT). This process effectively achieves a far-field
region at a relatively shorter distance. The limited spatial re-
gion where the collimated wave directed by the reflector gen-
erates uniform plane waves is known as quiet zone (QZ). This
zone is situated much closer to the reflector than the far-field
distance of the feed antenna alone. The measurement setup in-
cludes an ultra-wideband dual polarized transmit (Tx) Vivaldi
antenna which emits a spherical wave positioned at the focal

point of the parabolic reflector. This spherical wave is then
converted into a plane wave by the parabolic reflector in a QZ
area of 20 cm. The AUT is affixed to a rotator whose angular
rotation is controlled by a proportional-integral (PI) controller
motor, enabling a complete 360◦rotation for angular adjust-
ment of the AUT. A 2.4 mm standard Agilent N5224A vector
network analyzer (VNA) was used to capture the S21 magni-
tude. Other equipment includes 2.4 mm standard connectors,
right-angled adapters, and cables. This measurement system is
portable and can be placed at any convenient place in an open
space. As the main source of reflections in mmWave bands is
mainly from the ground, the ground and back side of AUT are
covered with absorber cones, as can be noticed in Fig. 9. Be-
cause of high path loss and the directional nature of mmWave
array antennas, sidewall reflections are not significant.
To control the VNA and the angular rotation of the posi-
tioner, we designed a custom-made LabVIEW program to carry
out instrument control using SCPI commands (Standard Com-
mands for Programmable Instruments) communicated through
the VISA (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture) controller
protocol. A standard NI GPIB-USB cable interface was used
to connect the VNA to the PC, while the PI motor controller
was connected to the PC using a USB interface. A continuous
wave (CW) signal was generated using the LabVIEW program
at each desired operating frequency, and the radiation pattern
measurement (i.e., |S21|) was automatically recorded at precise
angular positions over 180◦with a 1◦step size (from −90◦to
+90◦). Although full 360◦measurements can be done, how-
ever, the back side of the designed antenna is fully grounded
(high front-to-back ratio); therefore, the back half of the array
was omitted in the measurements and is not significant.

FIGURE 11. Measured radiation patterns in x-z plane. (a) Linear array pattern with wider beamwidth. (b) Planar array pattern with narrow beamwidth.
The radiation pattern was measured at three different fre-
quencies, i.e., 27, 28, and 29 GHz. The measurement setup is
shown in Fig. 10. The AUT was first mounted on the posi-
tioner (connected to port 2 of the VNA), and S21 was analyzed
for a CW signal of 27 GHz. Since we utilized only one polar-
ization of the Tx antenna at a time, it is important to ensure that
the value of S21 is optimized for maximum performance before
starting the measurement. This can be easily verified by testing
each cable of the dual-polarized Tx antenna individually to de-
termine which configuration yields the highest S21 value. This
configuration would mean that the polarization of the Tx an-
tenna and AUT match (i.e., co-pol case). The X-pol case was
obtained by swapping the cable of the Tx antenna. Otherwise,
it can also be obtained by simply rotating either of the Tx or Rx
antenna by 90◦and performing the same set of measurements.
The dynamic range of the CATR system was around 35 dB,
which was sufficient to measure the radiation patterns and null
depths. First, AUT was mounted vertically on the rotator. As
shown in Fig. 10, this orientation of the antenna provided wider
HPBW, and thus it can be referred to as x-z cut (or phi 0◦of
CST) simulations. The measured x-z patterns of linear and pla-
nar arrays at different frequency points are shown in Fig. 11.
One of the limitations of the presented CATR system is hav-
ing only one degree of freedom for the azimuth rotation of the
positioner. When measuring antenna arrays, it is required to
measure both azimuth and elevation patterns to describe the ra-
diation profile of mmWave antenna array accurately. For in-
stance, for the fan-beam pattern of a linear array, the azimuth
plane has a wider HPBW while the elevational plane has a nar-
rower HPBW. To overcome this measurement limitation with
a cost-effective solution and to measure the radiation pattern in
the orthogonal plane, we utilized a 2.4 mm standard right angle
to rotate the AUT by 90◦.
With this approach, the elevational plane pattern (which in
this case matches to phi 90◦cut of CST simulations) can be
measured over a complete 180◦by simply rotating the AUT
along the horizon, as demonstrated in Fig. 10. However, it is
important to mention that while AUT is rotated to 90◦(while us-
ing a right angle adapter), the Tx cable should also be switched

to orthogonal polarization to match the required polarization
(co- or x-pol).
The measured radiation patterns of the planar array in the ele-
vation plane are shown in Fig. 12. Both co- and X-pol patterns
were measured. The measured HPBW, sidelobe levels, and null
depths match the simulated results reasonably well. Minor dis-
crepancies can be further eliminated through reduced angular
steps and refined fabrication processes, as surface roughness
and fabrication tolerance might have adverse effects, especially
at mmWave frequencies. The beam squint is up to −20◦due to
the inherent characteristics of the series-fed configuration. The
variation in measured HPBW lies within 1◦whereas the mea-
sured null depths and SLLs vary within 3 dB as compared to the
simulated results.
Note that here we demonstrated the radiation pattern mea-
surements using two ports of the VNA to provide a pervasive
simple solution for measurements (as 2-port VNA is relatively
widely available). In the case of 4-port VNA, two of the VNA
ports can simultaneously be used for dual-polarized Tx antenna,
while the third VNA port can be used for AUT. In that case,
S21 and S31 can be captured simultaneously using a customized
software program in which one of the transmission coefficients
will correspond to co-pol (while the other will correspond to
x-pol based, corresponding to the orientation of AUT).
The gain of an mmWave antenna array is an important pa-
rameter, as it helps to mitigate path loss and calculate effective
isotropic radiated power at the transmitter end. In this work,
we measured the realized gain of the AUT by using the gain-
transfer (or gain-comparison) method. An mmWave standard
gain horn (SGH) antenna with a known gain was used to mea-
sure the gain of the AUT. Initially, the relative gain was con-
ducted, and by comparing these measurements to the known
gain of the standard antenna, actual gain values of AUT were
determined. The process requires two sets of measurements
(at each operating frequency point, 0.5 GHz step here) In the
first set, the SGH was used as a receiving antenna, and the best
maximum received power (S21Horn) was recorded. In the sec-
ond set, the SGH was replaced by AUT, and the received power
(S21AUT) was recorded. In both sets, the geometric configura-
tion should remain unchanged, except for the replacement of
the AUT and SGH, whereas the input power (PT ) remains the
same (−10 dBm in our measurements).
Note that in the relative gain measurement method, the effect
of path loss (PL) is potentially eliminated, and the system’s cali-

copper metal thickness (mt) of 18 µm. Initially, a patch an-
tenna element is designed on the resonance band of 28 GHz. Al-
though a single patch antenna is inherently narrowband, the col-
lective response of multiple resonances from various series-fed
patch elements combines to form a wideband impedance band-
width [36]. Then, more patch elements were added to the first
element in a series-fed topology, and reflection bandwidth was
analyzed. The design evolution is illustrated in Fig. 3(a) along
with results of −10 dB impedance bandwidth. In this approach,
the widths and lengths are analytically calculated and tuned to
achieve a linear array of patches that radiate with the desired
amplitudes and phases around the 28 GHz band. A small ta-
pering is applied to the width of the first patch element to fur-
ther fine-tune the −10 dB impedance bandwidth. The patch ele-
ments are spaced at a distance of approximately λ0/2 (where λ0
is the free space wavelength at 28 GHz) to ensure optimal per-
formance and minimize mutual coupling. The design initially
ran through an extensive analytical and simulation process for
its critical parameters such as the length and width of the patch
antennas, main feed width, and inter-element length.
For the design evolution steps of Fig. 2(a), the width (W)
and length (L) of the microstrip patch element at 28 GHz were
calculated using standard patch antenna equations as [37]:

Here, fr is the desired operational frequency, c the speed of

tive relative permittivity of the substrate, h the thickness of the
substrate, and ∆L the extended length of the patch that accounts
for the fringing effect and depends on the dielectric constant,
width, and height of the substrate. The effective permittivity
and extended length are calculated as:

fine-tuned to achieve a −10 dB impedance bandwidth of at least
3 GHz around 28 GHz, thereby covering the 26.5–29.5 GHz
band with the desired radiation pattern and gain characteris-
tics, ensuring robust performance for mmWave applications.
It is worth mentioning here that the inter-element gap in this
series-fed linear array has a significant impact on the input
impedance and overall antenna performance, as illustrated in
Fig. 2(b). During the design process, we thoroughly investi-
gated the effect of varying the inter-element gap (by keeping
the width of patches constant) on key performance parameters
such as impedance matching, gain, and efficiency. The gap de-
fines the electrical length of the whole linear array and governs
the progressive phase shifts between array elements. Hence,
the phase constant can change accordingly which has an impact
on the input impedance as well as the radiation pattern (partic-
ularly beam-squint) of the array. The optimal gap value was
fine-tuned to be 2.82 mm, which provided the finest trade-off
between these factors in this design. The dimensions of the
fine-tuned linear array are shown in Fig. 2(c).
To achieve a compact planar array form factor, a 4-channel
equal power divider is designed as shown in Fig. 2(d). The

matching to ensure efficient power distribution to each element.

rious emissions through the corner. The interelement spacing

copper metal thickness (mt) of 18 µm. Initially, a patch an-
tenna element is designed on the resonance band of 28 GHz. Al-
though a single patch antenna is inherently narrowband, the col-
lective response of multiple resonances from various series-fed
patch elements combines to form a wideband impedance band-
width [36]. Then, more patch elements were added to the first
element in a series-fed topology, and reflection bandwidth was
analyzed. The design evolution is illustrated in Fig. 3(a) along
with results of −10 dB impedance bandwidth. In this approach,
the widths and lengths are analytically calculated and tuned to
achieve a linear array of patches that radiate with the desired
amplitudes and phases around the 28 GHz band. A small ta-
pering is applied to the width of the first patch element to fur-
ther fine-tune the −10 dB impedance bandwidth. The patch ele-
ments are spaced at a distance of approximately λ0/2 (where λ0
is the free space wavelength at 28 GHz) to ensure optimal per-
formance and minimize mutual coupling. The design initially
ran through an extensive analytical and simulation process for
its critical parameters such as the length and width of the patch
antennas, main feed width, and inter-element length.
For the design evolution steps of Fig. 2(a), the width (W)
and length (L) of the microstrip patch element at 28 GHz were
calculated using standard patch antenna equations as [37]:

Here, fr is the desired operational frequency, c the speed of
light, εr the relative permittivity of the substrate, εeff the effec-
tive relative permittivity of the substrate, h the thickness of the
substrate, and ∆L the extended length of the patch that accounts
for the fringing effect and depends on the dielectric constant,
width, and height of the substrate. The effective permittivity
and extended length are calculated as:

At mmWave frequencies, the edge-launched feed offers easy

ments. The width of the main feed line was matched to 50 Ω

timized value of 0.623 mm.

An extensive parametric sweep was applied during the de-

the width and length of the series-connected feed lines. The
lengths and widths of the whole linear array were collectively
fine-tuned to achieve a −10 dB impedance bandwidth of at least

4. PROTOTYPE FABRICATION AND OTA RADIATION
PATTERN AND GAIN MEASUREMENTS ON CATR
The prototypes of both antenna arrays were fabricated using an
LPKF milling machine. The measurement setup for the reflec-
tion coefficient of both arrays is shown in Fig. 6. The mea-
sured results match well with the simulated response, as shown
in Fig. 7. Some discrepancies are due to fabrication tolerance,
surface roughness, and probable variation in the actual dielec-
tric constant at the mmWave band.
The contemporary 5G and beyond applications necessitate
a balance of performance, simplicity of fabrication, and inte-
gration capabilities, for which microstrip antenna arrays are a
prominent candidate. In particular, 5G new radio in mmWave
bands necessitates the radiation performance assessments
through over-the-air (OTA) testing, rather than conventional
conducted methods [38, 39].
This is because, at mmWave
frequencies, the antenna size predominantly influences the

far-field distance. Consequently, for larger mmWave antenna
arrays, the far-field distance increases in proportion to the
square of the antenna size along with a significant increase
in path loss [33]. This renders direct far-field measurements
impractical for larger antenna arrays. Furthermore, mmWave
antennas are usually integrated with RF frontends, and thus
lack of accessibility to the individual antenna connectors ren-
ders conventional testing methods impractical [33, 34]. To put
this into physical context, consider an mmWave antenna array
with a maximum dimension of 15 cm. At 28 GHz, a minimum
separation of 4.2 meters would be necessary for its far-field
testing. However, this extended measurement distance would
result in a substantial free-space path loss about 73.9 dB,
posing challenges for a system with a restricted dynamic range.
Hence, due to the deterrent effects of conventional direct
far-field measurement methods for large mmWave arrays
and devices, assessing the performance of mmWave devices
for 5G and beyond necessitates an alternative measurement
approach, such as OTA indirect test methods [28]. CATR is
one of the 3GPP-approved [40] indirect far-field test methods,
as demonstrated in Fig. 8.
In this work, we utilized the R&S® ATS800B CATR bench-
top setup, as shown in Fig. 9. The CATR leverages the optical
collimation attributes of a parabolic reflector to transform the
spherical wavefront originating from the feed antenna into a
planar wave at a very short distance towards the Antenna Un-
der Test (AUT). This process effectively achieves a far-field
region at a relatively shorter distance. The limited spatial re-
gion where the collimated wave directed by the reflector gen-
erates uniform plane waves is known as quiet zone (QZ). This
zone is situated much closer to the reflector than the far-field
distance of the feed antenna alone. The measurement setup in-
cludes an ultra-wideband dual polarized transmit (Tx) Vivaldi
antenna which emits a spherical wave positioned at the focal

point of the parabolic reflector. This spherical wave is then
converted into a plane wave by the parabolic reflector in a QZ
area of 20 cm. The AUT is affixed to a rotator whose angular
rotation is controlled by a proportional-integral (PI) controller
motor, enabling a complete 360◦rotation for angular adjust-
ment of the AUT. A 2.4 mm standard Agilent N5224A vector
network analyzer (VNA) was used to capture the S21 magni-
tude. Other equipment includes 2.4 mm standard connectors,
right-angled adapters, and cables. This measurement system is
portable and can be placed at any convenient place in an open
space. As the main source of reflections in mmWave bands is
mainly from the ground, the ground and back side of AUT are
covered with absorber cones, as can be noticed in Fig. 9. Be-
cause of high path loss and the directional nature of mmWave
array antennas, sidewall reflections are not significant.
To control the VNA and the angular rotation of the posi-
tioner, we designed a custom-made LabVIEW program to carry
out instrument control using SCPI commands (Standard Com-
mands for Programmable Instruments) communicated through
the VISA (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture) controller
protocol. A standard NI GPIB-USB cable interface was used
to connect the VNA to the PC, while the PI motor controller
was connected to the PC using a USB interface. A continuous
wave (CW) signal was generated using the LabVIEW program
at each desired operating frequency, and the radiation pattern
measurement (i.e., |S21|) was automatically recorded at precise
angular positions over 180◦with a 1◦step size (from −90◦to
+90◦). Although full 360◦measurements can be done, how-
ever, the back side of the designed antenna is fully grounded
(high front-to-back ratio); therefore, the back half of the array
was omitted in the measurements and is not significant.

FIGURE 11. Measured radiation patterns in x-z plane. (a) Linear array pattern with wider beamwidth. (b) Planar array pattern with narrow beamwidth.
The radiation pattern was measured at three different fre-
quencies, i.e., 27, 28, and 29 GHz. The measurement setup is
shown in Fig. 10. The AUT was first mounted on the posi-
tioner (connected to port 2 of the VNA), and S21 was analyzed
for a CW signal of 27 GHz. Since we utilized only one polar-
ization of the Tx antenna at a time, it is important to ensure that
the value of S21 is optimized for maximum performance before
starting the measurement. This can be easily verified by testing
each cable of the dual-polarized Tx antenna individually to de-
termine which configuration yields the highest S21 value. This
configuration would mean that the polarization of the Tx an-
tenna and AUT match (i.e., co-pol case). The X-pol case was
obtained by swapping the cable of the Tx antenna. Otherwise,
it can also be obtained by simply rotating either of the Tx or Rx
antenna by 90◦and performing the same set of measurements.
The dynamic range of the CATR system was around 35 dB,
which was sufficient to measure the radiation patterns and null
depths. First, AUT was mounted vertically on the rotator. As
shown in Fig. 10, this orientation of the antenna provided wider
HPBW, and thus it can be referred to as x-z cut (or phi 0◦of
CST) simulations. The measured x-z patterns of linear and pla-
nar arrays at different frequency points are shown in Fig. 11.
One of the limitations of the presented CATR system is hav-
ing only one degree of freedom for the azimuth rotation of the
positioner. When measuring antenna arrays, it is required to
measure both azimuth and elevation patterns to describe the ra-
diation profile of mmWave antenna array accurately. For in-
stance, for the fan-beam pattern of a linear array, the azimuth
plane has a wider HPBW while the elevational plane has a nar-
rower HPBW. To overcome this measurement limitation with
a cost-effective solution and to measure the radiation pattern in
the orthogonal plane, we utilized a 2.4 mm standard right angle
to rotate the AUT by 90◦.
With this approach, the elevational plane pattern (which in
this case matches to phi 90◦cut of CST simulations) can be
measured over a complete 180◦by simply rotating the AUT
along the horizon, as demonstrated in Fig. 10. However, it is
important to mention that while AUT is rotated to 90◦(while us-
ing a right angle adapter), the Tx cable should also be switched

to orthogonal polarization to match the required polarization
(co- or x-pol).
The measured radiation patterns of the planar array in the ele-
vation plane are shown in Fig. 12. Both co- and X-pol patterns
were measured. The measured HPBW, sidelobe levels, and null
depths match the simulated results reasonably well. Minor dis-
crepancies can be further eliminated through reduced angular
steps and refined fabrication processes, as surface roughness
and fabrication tolerance might have adverse effects, especially
at mmWave frequencies. The beam squint is up to −20◦due to
the inherent characteristics of the series-fed configuration. The
variation in measured HPBW lies within 1◦whereas the mea-
sured null depths and SLLs vary within 3 dB as compared to the
simulated results.
Note that here we demonstrated the radiation pattern mea-
surements using two ports of the VNA to provide a pervasive
simple solution for measurements (as 2-port VNA is relatively
widely available). In the case of 4-port VNA, two of the VNA
ports can simultaneously be used for dual-polarized Tx antenna,
while the third VNA port can be used for AUT. In that case,
S21 and S31 can be captured simultaneously using a customized
software program in which one of the transmission coefficients
will correspond to co-pol (while the other will correspond to
x-pol based, corresponding to the orientation of AUT).
The gain of an mmWave antenna array is an important pa-
rameter, as it helps to mitigate path loss and calculate effective
isotropic radiated power at the transmitter end. In this work,
we measured the realized gain of the AUT by using the gain-
transfer (or gain-comparison) method. An mmWave standard
gain horn (SGH) antenna with a known gain was used to mea-
sure the gain of the AUT. Initially, the relative gain was con-
ducted, and by comparing these measurements to the known
gain of the standard antenna, actual gain values of AUT were
determined. The process requires two sets of measurements
(at each operating frequency point, 0.5 GHz step here) In the
first set, the SGH was used as a receiving antenna, and the best
maximum received power (S21Horn) was recorded. In the sec-
ond set, the SGH was replaced by AUT, and the received power
(S21AUT) was recorded. In both sets, the geometric configura-
tion should remain unchanged, except for the replacement of
the AUT and SGH, whereas the input power (PT ) remains the
same (−10 dBm in our measurements).
Note that in the relative gain measurement method, the effect
of path loss (PL) is potentially eliminated, and the system’s cali-
