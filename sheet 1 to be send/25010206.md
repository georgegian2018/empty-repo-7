## SECTION 3: EQUATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS

### 3.1 Patch Antenna Width Calculation

**Equation (1): Microstrip Patch Width**

$$W = \frac{c}{2f_r\sqrt{\frac{2}{\varepsilon_r + 1}}}$$

Where:
- **W** = Width of microstrip patch element (mm)
- **c** = Speed of light (3 × 10⁸ m/s)
- **f_r** = Desired operational frequency (Hz)
- **ε_r** = Relative permittivity of substrate

**Application for 28 GHz Design:**
- Substrate: RO3003 (ε_r = 3)
- Calculated initial width refined through parametric tuning
- Final optimized value: approximately 3 mm (approximate λ/2 at 28 GHz)

---

### 3.2 Patch Antenna Length Calculation

**Equation (2): Microstrip Patch Length**

$$L = \frac{c}{2f_r\sqrt{\varepsilon_{eff}}} - 2\Delta L$$

Where:
- **L** = Length of microstrip patch element (mm)
- **ε_eff** = Effective relative permittivity of substrate
- **Δ L** = Extended length accounting for fringing effects

**Application for 28 GHz Design:**
- Accounts for fringing field effects at patch edges
- Temperature and substrate-dependent effects included
- Final optimized length: approximately 13 mm for linear array

---

### 3.3 Effective Permittivity Calculation

**Equation (3): Effective Relative Permittivity**

$$\varepsilon_{eff} = \frac{\varepsilon_r + 1}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{2}\left[1 + 12\frac{h}{W}\right]^{-1/2}$$

Where:
- **ε_eff** = Effective relative permittivity
- **ε_r** = Relative permittivity of substrate (3 for RO3003)
- **h** = Thickness of substrate (0.25 mm)
- **W** = Width of patch element

**Design Significance:**
- Accounts for fringing fields in microstrip structures
- Width-to-height ratio crucial for accurate calculation
- Affects resonant frequency and impedance matching

---

### 3.4 Extended Length Calculation (Fringing Effects)

**Equation (4): Extended Length for Fringing Effects**

$$\Delta L = 0.412h\frac{(\varepsilon_{eff} + 0.3)\left(\frac{W}{h} + 0.264\right)}{(\varepsilon_{eff} - 0.258)\left(\frac{W}{h} + 0.8\right)}$$

Where:
- **Δ L** = Extended length accounting for fringing effects (mm)
- **h** = Substrate thickness (0.25 mm)
- **ε_eff** = Effective relative permittivity (calculated from Eq. 3)
- **W** = Patch width

**Physical Interpretation:**
- Represents additional electrical length due to fringing fields
- Depends on dielectric constant and geometry
- Critical for accurate resonant frequency prediction
- Typically adds 0.4–0.5 mm to calculated length

---

### 3.5 Feed Line Width for 50 Ω Impedance

**Equation (5): Microstrip Feed Line Width**

$$w_f = \frac{7.48 \times H}{e^{Z_0\sqrt{(\varepsilon_r + 1.41)/87}} - (1.25 \times m_t)}$$

Where:
- **w_f** = Feed line width (mm)
- **H** = Substrate height/thickness (0.25 mm)
- **Z₀** = Characteristic impedance (50 Ω)
- **ε_r** = Relative permittivity (3)
- **m_t** = Metal thickness (18 µm copper)

**Design Application:**
- Optimized feed line width: 0.623 mm
- Ensures 50 Ω impedance matching
- Critical for loss minimization and signal integrity
- Fine-tuned after initial calculation through EM simulation

---

### 3.6 Array Spacing for Mutual Coupling Minimization

**Spacing Criterion:**

$$g = \frac{\lambda_0}{2} \text{ at center frequency}$$

Where:
- **g** = Inter-element spacing (mm)
- **λ₀** = Free space wavelength at operating frequency

**Application for 28 GHz Planar Array:**
- Center frequency: 28 GHz
- Free space wavelength: λ₀ = c/f = 10.71 mm
- Optimal spacing: g = λ₀/2 = 5.34 mm
- Minimizes mutual coupling between elements
- Maintains phase coherence across array

---

### 3.7 Friis Transmission Equation (Gain Measurement Basis)

**Friis Transmission Equation (Simplified for Gain Measurement):**

$$G_{AUT} = G_{SGH} \times \frac{S21_{AUT}}{S21_{Horn}} \times \frac{PL_{cancel}}{PL_{cancel}}$$

Effective formula for relative gain measurement:

$$G_{AUT} = G_{SGH} + 20\log\left(\frac{S21_{AUT}}{S21_{Horn}}\right)$$

Where:
- **G_AUT** = Gain of antenna under test (dBi)
- **G_SGH** = Known gain of standard gain horn (dBi)
- **S21_AUT** = Measured transmission coefficient with AUT (dB)
- **S21_Horn** = Measured transmission coefficient with SGH (dB)
- **PL_cancel** = Path loss cancellation through ratio (no unit)

**Measurement Method Advantages:**
- Path loss automatically eliminated in S21 ratio
- No need for absolute path loss knowledge
- Reduces measurement uncertainty
- Simplifies experimental procedure
