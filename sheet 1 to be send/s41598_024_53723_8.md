## Abstract (as in paper)

```text
This paper presents a wideband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna with high gain and isolation, as well as beam tilting capability, for 5G millimeter wave (MMW) applications. A single bow-tie antenna fed by a substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) is proposed to cover the 28 GHz band (26.5–29.5 GHz) with a maximum gain of 6.35 dB. To enhance the gain, H-shaped metamaterial (MM)- based components are incorporated into the antenna substrate. The trust-region (TR) gradient-based search algorithm is employed to optimize the H-shape dimensions and to achieve a maximum gain of 11.2 dB at 29.2 GHz. The MM structure offers zero index refraction at the desired range. Subsequently, the MIMO system is constructed with two vertically arranged radiators. Another MM, a modified square resonator (MSR), is embedded between the two radiators to reduce the mutual coupling and to tilt the antenna main beam. Herein, the TR algorithm is again used to optimize the MSR dimensions, and to enhance the isolation to a maximum of 75 dB at 28.6 GHz. Further, the MSR can tilt the E-plane radiation by ± 20° with respect to the end-fire direction when alternating between the two ports’ excitation. The developed system is validated experimentally with a good matching between the simulated and measured data.

## Simulation Results and Performance Metrics

Gain enhancement based on optimized MMs
An array of modified H-shaped MMs has been added to the antenna substrate in the end-fire direction (the 
xy-plane) to augment the gain. Figure 3 illustrates the antenna configuration with the MMs incorporated. By 
inserting the intial MMs into the antenna substrate and appropriate numerical optimization of their geometry 
parameters, it is possible to shorten the design cycle, including the adjustments to geometry dimensions, while 
achieving the optimum design. In this context, optimization of the MMs embedded into the antenna system 
(rather than designing the structure separately and then integrating it into the antenna substrate, which neces-
sitates re-optimizing the number and location of unit cells), allows for saving time and resources, as compared 
to carrying out these stages separately. The reflection coefficient and gain plots of the stand-alone antenna and 
the MM antenna (before and after the optimization) have been depicted in Fig. 4. It can be observed that the 
inclusion of the MM has a minor impact on the impedance matching performance, where the bandwidth is 
only slightly shifted downwards to 26–29.8 GHz, compared to the initial antenna’s bandwidth of 26.2–30 GHz. 
Nevertheless, the antenna remains capable of covering the 5G band (26.5–29.5 GHz). On the other hand, the 
stand-alone antenna’s gain, which ranges from 5.8 to 6.35 dB in the 26.5–30 GHz band, is deemed insufficient

for MMW communications. Before optimization, the initial H-shape design is incorporated in front of the radia-
tion element. This preliminary design lacks the ZIM property, as indicated by the slight gain increase. As the 
gain of the antenna is known to be proportional to its aperture, the marginal gain increase before optimization 
can be attributed to the expansion of the substrate size to accommodate the MMs. The MM antenna’s gain is 
notably enhanced prior to optimization, particularly below 29 GHz, compared to the stand-alone antenna. This 
suggests that further enhancements are achievable through suitable design optimization using formal numeri-
cal techniques. The TR gradient-based search procedure is employed to optimize the structure dimensions and 
to achieve a maximum gain of 11.2 dB at 29.2 GHz, cf. Figure 4. The details of the optimization process can be 
found in Section “MMs antenna optimization”.

MMs antenna optimization
The proposed antenna is first optimized as a stand-alone (single) structure with the objective being gain enhance-
ment. The adjustable parameters selected for the optimization process are x = [Lu Wu Lu2 Wu1]T, all explained 
in Fig. 5a. The parameter space X is set up using the following ranges: 0.6 ≤ Lu ≤ 3 mm, 0.6 ≤ Wu ≤ 1.5 mm, 
0.2 ≤ Lu2 ≤ 1 mm, and 0.2 ≤ Wu1 ≤ 1.6 mm. Furthermore, we have the following constraints, which are imposed 
to ensure the geometrical consistency of the antenna structure: Lu2 ≥ 0.2 mm, Lu1 = (Lu − 2Lu2) ≥ 0.2 mm, and 
Wu1 ≤ Wu − 0.4.
The primary objective is to increase the average in-band gain G(x) within the frequency range F = [26.5 29.5] 
GHz. The secondary objective is to ensure that |S11(x,f)| ≤ –10 dB for all f ∈ F. Consequently, the objective func-
tion (to be minimized) is defined as

are the mean realized gain and maximum in-band reflection, respectively. The optimum design x* is found by 
solving
Note that minimization of the objective function U leads to the improvement of the average gain, as well 
as enforcing the matching condition. The penalty coefficient β28 is set to 100 to ensure that |S11(x, f)| ≤ –10 dB 
over the bandwidth F within a tolerance of a fraction of dB. Formally speaking, the reflection requirement is an 
inequality constraint; however, due to being expensive to evaluate (required EM analysis), its implicit handling 
is more ­convenient29. The problem (4) is solved using the trust-region (TR) gradient-based ­algorithm30 with 
antenna response sensitivities estimated using finite ­differentiation31. The TR procedure yields a series x(i), i = 0, 
1, …, of approximations to x* as x(i+1) = argmin{x; ||x – x(i)|| ≤ d(i): UL(x)}, where the local objective function UL is 
defined as in (1) but evaluated using a first-order Taylor expansion model of antenna characteristics rather than 
directly through EM analysis. The search region size d(i) is adaptively adjusted using conventional TR ­rules30. 
The TR sub-problem is solved using the SQP ­algorithm32 implemented in Matlab Optimization ­Toolbox33. The 
termination condition is convergence in argument (||x(i+1) – x(i)|| < ε; here, ε = ­10–3). The initial design x(0) = [2 
1.2 0.2 0.3]T has been found using parametric studies. The optimized design obtained through optimization 
is x* = [1.603 1.415 0.452 0.755]T (dimensions in mm). The initial and optimized antenna responses can be 
found in Fig. 4. The optimized MM unit cell is shown in Fig. 5a. To ensure the required response, the boundary 
arrangement is assigned on all sides of the unit cell. The electric (magnetic) conductor boundary is allocated 
along the x(z)-direction. The y-axis is set to propagate a normal incident electromagnetic wave. Along the y-axis, 
the normally incident electromagnetic wave propagates. The incident waves excite the resonator structure, and 
electromagnetic interaction occurs within the unit cell, creating resonance in the transmitted and reflected waves. 
Choosing the y-axis for exciting the unit cell is justified by the fact that MIMO antennas serve as the origin of the 
electromagnetic wave, propagating through the unit cells along the y-direction—the established mode of propaga-
tion for the MM unit cell, as elucidated above. The structure response and the retrieved constitutive parameters 
are presented in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. The structure exhibits a zero-index characteristic within the desired 
range of 26.5–30 GHz, cf. Figure 6b. The zero-index metamaterial (ZIM) functions as a meta-lens, concentrating 
radiation in the emission direction. The 3D radiation patterns of the SIW-based antenna at 28 GHz without and

with ZIM are depicted in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. The discernible change in the radiation pattern is evident in 
Fig. 7b, illustrating the meta-lens property of the MM. With ZIM loading, the antenna radiation displays height-
ened directivity in the end-fire direction along the y-axis, leading to a notable gain enhancement, as portrayed 
in Fig. 4. This remarkable feature, ZIM, can be leveraged to increase gain when combined with antennas. Gain 
enhancement can be explained using Snell’s law of refraction, which is expressed as sinθi · ni = sinθr • nr, where 
ni(θi) and nr(θr) represent the refractive indices (angles) of the incident and refraction rays. Figure 5b depicts 
the wave propagation in both MM and air. Herein, when the incident rays pass from a medium of zero refrac-
tive index (ni = nMM = 0) to a high refractive index medium (nr = nair = 1), the refracted rays will disseminate in a 
path normal to the interface. Therefore, the phase change of the electromagnetic wave approaches/equals zero, 
leading to gain improvement in the emission direction.

MIMO design and isolation enhancement
As previously stated, the MIMO technology has been proposed to improve channel capacity, spectrum efficiency, 
and data throughput while reducing the multipath effects. To ensure optimal performance in such systems, 
minimizing mutual coupling is essential. Figure 8 illustrates the MM-based MIMO configuration, with radiators 
arranged adjacently. The reflection and transmission coefficients of the MIMO without MSRs are depicted in 
Fig. 9. The system provides isolation of better than 26 dB over the desired band. The performance is acceptable, 
but there is a room for isolation improvement, which would be beneficial, especially in dense MIMO scenarios. 
Figure 10a illustrates the E-plane radiation patterns for both ports, showing directive radiations towards the 
y-direction without any inclination. MMs offer a promising solution for minimizing mutual coupling compared 
to traditional methods. To boost isolation and to enable beam tilting in the end-fire direction (y-direction), an 
array of MSRs has been integrated between the two radiators, as depicted in Fig. 8. In most cases, achieving 
optimal performance in MM design hinges upon proper parameter tuning, and there exists no definitive formula 
that can be employed to design all MM structures. Consequently, utilization of formal optimization techniques 
represents the most efficient and effective means of obtaining desired outcomes in a shorter time frame and less 
effort.

MIMO performance optimization
The MIMO version of the proposed antenna is optimized to ensure the required tilt of the E-plane radiation pat-
tern (here, α0 = 20°) at 28 GHz, as well as to improve antenna isolation |S21| within the frequency range F = [26.5 
29.5] GHz. Additional conditions are to maintain sufficient impedance matching |S11(x,f)| ≤ –10 dB, and gain 
g(x,f) ≥ 9 dB for all f ∈ F. The design variables selected for the optimization purpose are x = [Sl Sw Sl2 Sw1 Sw2 Sl1]T, 
all explained in Fig. 11a. The parameter space X is set using the following ranges: 1 ≤ Sl ≤ 4 mm, 1.4 ≤ Sw ≤ 2.3 mm, 
0.2 ≤ Sl2 ≤ 0.5 mm, 0.7 ≤ Sw1 ≤ 1.3 mm, 0.2 ≤ Sw2 ≤ 0.4 mm, and 2.7 ≤ Sl1 ≤ 4.5 mm. Additionally, we have three 
geometry constraints: Sw1 ≤ ((Sw − 2Sl2) − 0.4), Sl1 ≥ Sl, and Sw2 ≤ Sw1 − 0.4. The primary objective is to reduce 
the antenna isolation, defined as I(x) = max{f ∈ F: |S21(x,f)|} (i.e., as the maximum in-band transmission). The 
remaining conditions are handled as constraints. The objective function to be minimized is therefore defined as
where S(x) is defined in (3), the minimum in-band gain is defined as
whereas α(x) is the angle of maximum directivity extracted from the EM-simulated antenna farfield. The first 
two constraints are of inequality type with their violations quantified as relative ones, whereas the last one is the 
equality condition. The penalty coefficients are set to β1 = β2 = β3 = 100. It should be noted that although matching

and gain conditions are formally included into the objective function, they are to be almost automatically satis-
fied as the reflection coefficient and gain are only weakly-dependent on the parameters selected for isolation 
improvement. The initial design, obtained through parametric studies, is x(0) = [3.5 2.25 0.32 0.6 0.4 3.4]T [mm]. 
The optimized design x* = [2.984 2.102 0.342 0.968 0.203 3.573]T has been found by minimizing the objective 
function (5) similarly as in (4), using the trust-region algorithm outlined before. The initial and optimized 
antenna responses can be found in Figs. 8 and 9.
Figure 11a illustrates the MSR unit cell configuration, where the boundaries are established similarly to that 
of the H-shaped resonator. The structure consists of a square ring and two cross bars. The response of the struc-
ture and its constitutive parameters are presented in Fig. 11b and c, respectively. Notably, the structure exhibits 
negative values of ɛ, μ, and n at the resonance frequency of 28.6 GHz. The optimized MSR offers high isolation 
in the desired band with a maximum of 75 dB at 28.6 GHz, with an enhancement of about 47 dB over the bare 
MIMO system, cf. Figure 9. Further, the structure demonstrates a substantial permittivity of 6.5 and a refractive 
index of 2 at 28 GHz. It is worth noting that the actual substrate’s refractive index is merely 1.634. Hence, the 
proposed MM exhibits a significantly higher refractive index than the substrate, creating two different media 
with different refractive indices in the proximity of the radiator. This configuration causes the antenna beam to 
tilt toward the medium of a higher refractive index (MSR configuration). Excitation of Port 1 results in a + 20° 
tilt in the E-plane, whereas exciting Port 2 produces a deflection angle of − 20°, cf. Figure 10b. The electric field 
distributions at 28.6 GHz for the MIMO system without and with MMs are presented in Fig. 12a and b, where 
Port 1 is excited, and Port 2 is terminated by a 50-Ω load. During the simulation of the first antenna (Port 1) 
without the MMs, a significant mutual coupling field is evident at the second antenna (Port 2), as illustrated in

Fig. 12a. Conversely, with the inclusion of MMs, the coupling field diminishes at the second antenna, as shown 
in Fig. 12b, resulting in a reduction of mutual coupling. The upper MSR unit cells play a more substantial role 
in minimizing mutual coupling. It’s worth noting that the gain enhancement is substantiated by contrasting 
the electric fields of the bare MIMO and MM-based MIMO. The improvement in gain is evident as the field is 
distributed through the ZIMs, as shown in Fig. 12b.

Experimental results and discussion
The optimized MM-based MIMO has been fabricated to corroborate the numerical simulation outcomes and 
showcase its relevance for 5G applications. Figure 13a displays the front and back views of the MIMO antenna 
prototype. An Anritsu vector network analyzer MS4644B (0–40 GHz) was utilized to measure the reflection and 
transmission coefficients. The radiation patterns were validated in an anechoic chamber, as depicted in Fig. 13b. 
Figure 14 illustrates the comparison between the simulated and measured |S11| and mutual coupling |S21|. The 
developed MIMO provides a wide impedance bandwidth ranging from 26.2 to 30 GHz, effectively covering the 
5G band of 28 GHz (26.5–29.5 GHz). One can observe a satisfactory alignment between both datasets for |S11|. 
Nonetheless, a slight difference in resonant magnitude is observed between the measured and simulated data. 
Measured isolation, |S21|, indicates a good agreement with simulation, especially in frequencies below 28 GHz. 
The measured isolation results, particularly above 28 GHz, are notably inconsistent with the simulated data due to 
various factors, including fabrication tolerance, cable loss, assembly inaccuracies, and the use of bulky and closely 
spaced end-launch connectors. Figure 15 displays the MM-based MIMO’s simulated and measured realized gain 
plots when Port 1 is excited, and Port 2 is terminated with a 50-Ω load. In the desired band of 26.5–29.5 GHz, the 
simulated realized gain varies from 10 to 11 dB. The measured gain matches the simulation result for the entire 
band, although a minor discrepancy is observed at 28 GHz. This discrepancy is likely due to the same reasons 
mentioned earlier, such as manufacturing and antenna assembly inaccuracies, as well as angular inaccuracy in 
the antenna placement in the chamber. The co- and cross-polarization radiation patterns of the MM-inspired 
MIMO system in the E- and H-planes at 28 GHz are displayed in Fig. 16. The radiation results are introduced 
individually for Port 1 and Port 2, cf. Figure 16a and b, respectively. The developed system offers directional 
radiation in both planes with a low level of cross-polarized fields. Based on the ports excitation, the measured 
results confirm that the E-plane radiation is tilted by ± 20° at 28 GHz. The measured radiations correspond well 
with numerical simulation results for the E and H-planes at 28 GHz. Notably, the inactive port is terminated 
using the 50-Ω matched load during the measurements. The MM-based MIMO is investigated in terms of the

can be computed using the field-based formula and directly calculate DG from the resulting ­ECC17. Figure 17 
shows the ECC and DG plots. The ECC is < 0.5∙10–4 in the range of 26.5–29.5 GHz, which is considerably below 
the acceptable threshold of 0.5 for wireless systems. Additionally, the DG values are in proximity to the standard 
value of 10 dB.

Table 1 illustrates a performance comparison between the proposed MM-based MIMO and state-of-the-art 
structures reported in the recent literature. In contrast to the recent findings, the MIMO antenna developed in 
this work exhibits the highest isolation and gain. Further, it boasts a compact and low-profile design, a broad 
bandwidth, and exceptional diversity performance while also providing a beam tilting capability.

## Technical Specifications of Each Antenna or Relevant Component

### Antenna design (Section excerpt)

```text
Antenna design
The configuration of the proposed antenna has been shown in Fig. 1. It is essentially a bow-tie antenna fed by 
SIW. The structure consists of a microstrip line that feeds a microstrip-to-SIW transition, which, in turn, is 
connected to the front and the back parts of the bow-tie antenna. The antenna is printed on a Rogers RT5880 
substrate with a thickness of 0.508 mm, dielectric constant of 2.2, and tangent loss of 0.0009. The SIW- based

bow-tie antenna’s dimensions are calculated using the set equations presented ­in26. The calculated values of s, a, 
b, and wc are 4.9 mm, 2.4 mm, 2.33 mm, and 0.3 mm, respectively, which are used to obtain the initial design of 
the SIW-inspired bow-tie. Numerical simulations are then employed to fine-tune and finalize the antenna design, 
where the simulated values are s = 5.2 mm, a = 2.56 mm, b = 2.5 mm, and wc = 0.2 mm. The presence of the SIW 
feed and inaccuracies in the design equations account for the minor discrepancy between the initial and final 
values. The SIW is employed to work as a wideband ­balun27. Both microstrip lines to the SIW and from the SIW 
to the two bow-tie arms are tapered to improve the impedance matching. Figure 2 depicts the antenna reflection 
coefficient and the gain. The results indicate that the antenna has a wide bandwidth of 3.8 GHz (26.2–30 GHz), 
making it suitable for covering the 5G band of 28 GHz. However, the maximum gain of 6.35 dB within the opera-
tional bandwidth is relatively low for MMW communications. There is a growing need for high-gain antennas 
to counteract the path loss experienced at the MMW spectrum. To address this, MMs have been integrated with 
antennas to boost their gain performance.

### Gain enhancement structure and parameters (Section excerpt)

```text
Gain enhancement based on optimized MMs
An array of modified H-shaped MMs has been added to the antenna substrate in the end-fire direction (the 
xy-plane) to augment the gain. Figure 3 illustrates the antenna configuration with the MMs incorporated. By 
inserting the intial MMs into the antenna substrate and appropriate numerical optimization of their geometry 
parameters, it is possible to shorten the design cycle, including the adjustments to geometry dimensions, while 
achieving the optimum design. In this context, optimization of the MMs embedded into the antenna system 
(rather than designing the structure separately and then integrating it into the antenna substrate, which neces-
sitates re-optimizing the number and location of unit cells), allows for saving time and resources, as compared 
to carrying out these stages separately. The reflection coefficient and gain plots of the stand-alone antenna and 
the MM antenna (before and after the optimization) have been depicted in Fig. 4. It can be observed that the 
inclusion of the MM has a minor impact on the impedance matching performance, where the bandwidth is 
only slightly shifted downwards to 26–29.8 GHz, compared to the initial antenna’s bandwidth of 26.2–30 GHz. 
Nevertheless, the antenna remains capable of covering the 5G band (26.5–29.5 GHz). On the other hand, the 
stand-alone antenna’s gain, which ranges from 5.8 to 6.35 dB in the 26.5–30 GHz band, is deemed insufficient

for MMW communications. Before optimization, the initial H-shape design is incorporated in front of the radia-
tion element. This preliminary design lacks the ZIM property, as indicated by the slight gain increase. As the 
gain of the antenna is known to be proportional to its aperture, the marginal gain increase before optimization 
can be attributed to the expansion of the substrate size to accommodate the MMs. The MM antenna’s gain is 
notably enhanced prior to optimization, particularly below 29 GHz, compared to the stand-alone antenna. This 
suggests that further enhancements are achievable through suitable design optimization using formal numeri-
cal techniques. The TR gradient-based search procedure is employed to optimize the structure dimensions and 
to achieve a maximum gain of 11.2 dB at 29.2 GHz, cf. Figure 4. The details of the optimization process can be 
found in Section “MMs antenna optimization”.

### H-shaped MM optimization details (Section excerpt)

```text
MMs antenna optimization
The proposed antenna is first optimized as a stand-alone (single) structure with the objective being gain enhance-
ment. The adjustable parameters selected for the optimization process are x = [Lu Wu Lu2 Wu1]T, all explained 
in Fig. 5a. The parameter space X is set up using the following ranges: 0.6 ≤ Lu ≤ 3 mm, 0.6 ≤ Wu ≤ 1.5 mm, 
0.2 ≤ Lu2 ≤ 1 mm, and 0.2 ≤ Wu1 ≤ 1.6 mm. Furthermore, we have the following constraints, which are imposed 
to ensure the geometrical consistency of the antenna structure: Lu2 ≥ 0.2 mm, Lu1 = (Lu − 2Lu2) ≥ 0.2 mm, and 
Wu1 ≤ Wu − 0.4.
The primary objective is to increase the average in-band gain G(x) within the frequency range F = [26.5 29.5] 
GHz. The secondary objective is to ensure that |S11(x,f)| ≤ –10 dB for all f ∈ F. Consequently, the objective func-

are the mean realized gain and maximum in-band reflection, respectively. The optimum design x* is found by 
solving
Note that minimization of the objective function U leads to the improvement of the average gain, as well 
as enforcing the matching condition. The penalty coefficient β28 is set to 100 to ensure that |S11(x, f)| ≤ –10 dB 
over the bandwidth F within a tolerance of a fraction of dB. Formally speaking, the reflection requirement is an 
inequality constraint; however, due to being expensive to evaluate (required EM analysis), its implicit handling 
is more ­convenient29. The problem (4) is solved using the trust-region (TR) gradient-based ­algorithm30 with 
antenna response sensitivities estimated using finite ­differentiation31. The TR procedure yields a series x(i), i = 0, 
1, …, of approximations to x* as x(i+1) = argmin{x; ||x – x(i)|| ≤ d(i): UL(x)}, where the local objective function UL is 
defined as in (1) but evaluated using a first-order Taylor expansion model of antenna characteristics rather than 
directly through EM analysis. The search region size d(i) is adaptively adjusted using conventional TR ­rules30. 
The TR sub-problem is solved using the SQP ­algorithm32 implemented in Matlab Optimization ­Toolbox33. The 
termination condition is convergence in argument (||x(i+1) – x(i)|| < ε; here, ε = ­10–3). The initial design x(0) = [2 
1.2 0.2 0.3]T has been found using parametric studies. The optimized design obtained through optimization 
is x* = [1.603 1.415 0.452 0.755]T (dimensions in mm). The initial and optimized antenna responses can be 
found in Fig. 4. The optimized MM unit cell is shown in Fig. 5a. To ensure the required response, the boundary 
arrangement is assigned on all sides of the unit cell. The electric (magnetic) conductor boundary is allocated 
along the x(z)-direction. The y-axis is set to propagate a normal incident electromagnetic wave. Along the y-axis, 
the normally incident electromagnetic wave propagates. The incident waves excite the resonator structure, and 
electromagnetic interaction occurs within the unit cell, creating resonance in the transmitted and reflected waves. 
Choosing the y-axis for exciting the unit cell is justified by the fact that MIMO antennas serve as the origin of the 
electromagnetic wave, propagating through the unit cells along the y-direction—the established mode of propaga-
tion for the MM unit cell, as elucidated above. The structure response and the retrieved constitutive parameters 
are presented in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. The structure exhibits a zero-index characteristic within the desired 
range of 26.5–30 GHz, cf. Figure 6b. The zero-index metamaterial (ZIM) functions as a meta-lens, concentrating 
radiation in the emission direction. The 3D radiation patterns of the SIW-based antenna at 28 GHz without and

Fig. 7b, illustrating the meta-lens property of the MM. With ZIM loading, the antenna radiation displays height-
ened directivity in the end-fire direction along the y-axis, leading to a notable gain enhancement, as portrayed 
in Fig. 4. This remarkable feature, ZIM, can be leveraged to increase gain when combined with antennas. Gain 
enhancement can be explained using Snell’s law of refraction, which is expressed as sinθi · ni = sinθr • nr, where 
ni(θi) and nr(θr) represent the refractive indices (angles) of the incident and refraction rays. Figure 5b depicts 
the wave propagation in both MM and air. Herein, when the incident rays pass from a medium of zero refrac-
tive index (ni = nMM = 0) to a high refractive index medium (nr = nair = 1), the refracted rays will disseminate in a 
path normal to the interface. Therefore, the phase change of the electromagnetic wave approaches/equals zero, 
leading to gain improvement in the emission direction.

MIMO design and isolation enhancement
As previously stated, the MIMO technology has been proposed to improve channel capacity, spectrum efficiency, 
and data throughput while reducing the multipath effects. To ensure optimal performance in such systems, 
minimizing mutual coupling is essential. Figure 8 illustrates the MM-based MIMO configuration, with radiators 
arranged adjacently. The reflection and transmission coefficients of the MIMO without MSRs are depicted in 
Fig. 9. The system provides isolation of better than 26 dB over the desired band. The performance is acceptable, 
but there is a room for isolation improvement, which would be beneficial, especially in dense MIMO scenarios. 
Figure 10a illustrates the E-plane radiation patterns for both ports, showing directive radiations towards the 
y-direction without any inclination. MMs offer a promising solution for minimizing mutual coupling compared 
to traditional methods. To boost isolation and to enable beam tilting in the end-fire direction (y-direction), an 
array of MSRs has been integrated between the two radiators, as depicted in Fig. 8. In most cases, achieving 
optimal performance in MM design hinges upon proper parameter tuning, and there exists no definitive formula 
that can be employed to design all MM structures. Consequently, utilization of formal optimization techniques 
represents the most efficient and effective means of obtaining desired outcomes in a shorter time frame and less 
effort.

MIMO performance optimization
The MIMO version of the proposed antenna is optimized to ensure the required tilt of the E-plane radiation pat-
tern (here, α0 = 20°) at 28 GHz, as well as to improve antenna isolation |S21| within the frequency range F = [26.5 
29.5] GHz. Additional conditions are to maintain sufficient impedance matching |S11(x,f)| ≤ –10 dB, and gain 
g(x,f) ≥ 9 dB for all f ∈ F. The design variables selected for the optimization purpose are x = [Sl Sw Sl2 Sw1 Sw2 Sl1]T, 
all explained in Fig. 11a. The parameter space X is set using the following ranges: 1 ≤ Sl ≤ 4 mm, 1.4 ≤ Sw ≤ 2.3 mm, 
0.2 ≤ Sl2 ≤ 0.5 mm, 0.7 ≤ Sw1 ≤ 1.3 mm, 0.2 ≤ Sw2 ≤ 0.4 mm, and 2.7 ≤ Sl1 ≤ 4.5 mm. Additionally, we have three 
geometry constraints: Sw1 ≤ ((Sw − 2Sl2) − 0.4), Sl1 ≥ Sl, and Sw2 ≤ Sw1 − 0.4. The primary objective is to reduce 
the antenna isolation, defined as I(x) = max{f ∈ F: |S21(x,f)|} (i.e., as the maximum in-band transmission). The 
remaining conditions are handled as constraints. The objective function to be minimized is therefore defined as
where S(x) is defined in (3), the minimum in-band gain is defined as
whereas α(x) is the angle of maximum directivity extracted from the EM-simulated antenna farfield. The first 
two constraints are of inequality type with their violations quantified as relative ones, whereas the last one is the 
equality condition. The penalty coefficients are set to β1 = β2 = β3 = 100. It should be noted that although matching

and gain conditions are formally included into the objective function, they are to be almost automatically satis-
fied as the reflection coefficient and gain are only weakly-dependent on the parameters selected for isolation 
improvement. The initial design, obtained through parametric studies, is x(0) = [3.5 2.25 0.32 0.6 0.4 3.4]T [mm]. 
The optimized design x* = [2.984 2.102 0.342 0.968 0.203 3.573]T has been found by minimizing the objective 
function (5) similarly as in (4), using the trust-region algorithm outlined before. The initial and optimized 
antenna responses can be found in Figs. 8 and 9.
Figure 11a illustrates the MSR unit cell configuration, where the boundaries are established similarly to that 
of the H-shaped resonator. The structure consists of a square ring and two cross bars. The response of the struc-
ture and its constitutive parameters are presented in Fig. 11b and c, respectively. Notably, the structure exhibits 
negative values of ɛ, μ, and n at the resonance frequency of 28.6 GHz. The optimized MSR offers high isolation 
in the desired band with a maximum of 75 dB at 28.6 GHz, with an enhancement of about 47 dB over the bare 
MIMO system, cf. Figure 9. Further, the structure demonstrates a substantial permittivity of 6.5 and a refractive 
index of 2 at 28 GHz. It is worth noting that the actual substrate’s refractive index is merely 1.634. Hence, the 
proposed MM exhibits a significantly higher refractive index than the substrate, creating two different media 
with different refractive indices in the proximity of the radiator. This configuration causes the antenna beam to 
tilt toward the medium of a higher refractive index (MSR configuration). Excitation of Port 1 results in a + 20° 
tilt in the E-plane, whereas exciting Port 2 produces a deflection angle of − 20°, cf. Figure 10b. The electric field 
distributions at 28.6 GHz for the MIMO system without and with MMs are presented in Fig. 12a and b, where 
Port 1 is excited, and Port 2 is terminated by a 50-Ω load. During the simulation of the first antenna (Port 1) 
without the MMs, a significant mutual coupling field is evident at the second antenna (Port 2), as illustrated in

Fig. 12a. Conversely, with the inclusion of MMs, the coupling field diminishes at the second antenna, as shown 
in Fig. 12b, resulting in a reduction of mutual coupling. The upper MSR unit cells play a more substantial role 
in minimizing mutual coupling. It’s worth noting that the gain enhancement is substantiated by contrasting 
the electric fields of the bare MIMO and MM-based MIMO. The improvement in gain is evident as the field is 
distributed through the ZIMs, as shown in Fig. 12b.
