## III. ANTENNA ARRAY ENABLED EMERGING COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES

### A. New Beamforming Technologies

**Motivation:**
Conventional single-beam steering inadequate for future space/air/ground networks requiring:
- Massive user access
- High dynamics
- Limited RF chains
- On-demand coverage

#### 1) Single-RF-Chain Multiple Beams

**Problem Statement:**
- One RF chain typically generates one data stream
- Cannot serve all users as user count increases
- Limited RF chains in hybrid beamforming systems

**Solution Approaches:**

**Sub-Array Technique:**
- Divide antenna array into multiple sub-arrays
- Each sub-array generates beam in specific direction
- Adjacent antennas separated into groups
- Multiple sub-arrays generate analog beams to desired users

**Performance Analysis (64-Element Phased Array):**
- Two sub-arrays:
  - Generate 2 beams in different directions
  - Higher beam gain per beam
- Four sub-arrays:
  - Generate 4 beams
  - Lower beam gain per beam due to smaller sub-array size

**Trade-off:**
- Increasing sub-arrays = More beams but lower individual gains
- Must balance beam count and beam gain carefully

**Optimization Approach:**
For Nt-element array with I desired beams:

**Optimization Problem:**
$$\max_{f,\alpha} \alpha$$

**Subject to Constraints:**
$$|a^H_i f|^2 \geq \alpha, \quad i = 1, 2, ..., I$$
$$|[f]_n| = 1/\sqrt{N_t}, \quad n = 1, 2, ..., N_t$$

where:
- ai: steering vector of i-th desired beam
- f: analog beamforming vector
- α: slack variable for beam gain improvement
- I: total number of desired beams

**Lens Antenna Array Approach:**
- RF chain connected to lens antenna array
- New path division multiplexing paradigm
- Uses power splitter/mixer and switch
- Generates multiple beams via lens refraction
- Beam direction selection by antenna connection switching
- Significantly reduces beamforming complexity and hardware cost

#### 2) Flexible Beam Coverage

**Problem:**
- Conventional analog beamforming generates narrow beams to specific directions
- Some scenarios require wider beams or arbitrary-shaped coverage
- Target region may have random shapes and sizes

**Solution Requirements:**
- Wide beam covering large angular range
- Adaptive beam width adjustment per target area
- Flexible beam covering arbitrary shapes

**Wide Beam Implementation:**

*Sub-Array Scheme:*
- Large array divided into virtual sub-arrays
- Multiple sub-arrays generate beams
- Beams steered to evenly-spaced angles within beam coverage
- Multiple wide beams combination expands coverage range

*Optimization Scheme:*
- Alternating optimization algorithm (e.g., broadcast control signal coverage)
- Constraints:
  - Coverage probability for each user ≥ pre-determined threshold
  - Transmit power minimized

**Flexible Coverage (Arbitrary Shapes):**
- 3D beamforming with uniform plane array (UPA)
- Used for UAV-enabled mmWave communications

*Implementation Steps:*
1. Transform target area position coordinates to special-angle coordinates
2. Use wide beams to cover minimum rectangular envelope in angle domain
3. Design phase rotation for sub-arrays to reduce fluctuation
4. Beamforming gain concentrated in target coverage area

#### 3) Robust Beamforming

**Challenge:**
Many existing works assume:
- Known user positions
- Perfect CSI at base stations

**Reality:**
- Difficult to obtain accurate user position (mobility, GPS error)
- Complex propagation environment
- Finite pilot signal length
- Limited feedback bandwidth
- Training overhead grows with BS antenna size

**CSI Error Models:**

**Bounded CSI Error Model:**
- Estimation error confined within specific range
- Norm of channel estimation errors bounded by threshold

**Optimization Problem (Maximize Achievable Rate with CSI Errors):**
$$\max_{f,w} \min_\Delta \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{|w^H(\tilde{H} + \Delta)f|^2 P}{\sigma^2}\right)$$

**Subject to Constraints:**
$$|[w]_n| = 1/\sqrt{N_r}, \quad n = 1, 2, ..., N_r$$
$$|[f]_n| = 1/\sqrt{N_t}, \quad n = 1, 2, ..., N_t$$
$$\|\Delta\|^2 \leq \epsilon$$

where:
- H̃: imperfect CSI estimate
- Δ: CSI error
- σ²: white Gaussian noise power
- ε: CSI error bound
- Approach: Convert to convex sub-problems solvable by convex optimization

**Probabilistic CSI Error Model:**
- Channel estimation errors statistically independent from estimated matrix
- Characterized by matrix-variate complex circular Gaussian distribution
- Solution: Penalty dual decomposition based algorithm
- Jointly optimize digital and analog beamforming
- Maximize worst-case sum rate

### B. Multi-Antenna Multiple Access

**Overview:**
Traditional multiple access: TDMA, FDMA, CDMA

**Multi-antenna System Advantages:**
- Access to spatial domain via antenna arrays
- High antenna gain by beam direction control
- Data rate increase via simultaneous independent information transmission
- Reliability improvement via redundant signal transmission

**Three Advanced Multiple Access Technologies:**

#### 1) SDMA (Space-Division Multiple Access)

**Definition:**
Also known as Beam Division Multiple Access (BDMA)

**Mechanism:**
- Uses linear precoders/beamformers at transmitter
- Separates users in spatial domain
- Effective capacity increase
- Quality improvement

**Architecture:**
- BS generates different beams
- Allocates beams to different user positions
- Users covered by different beams transmit in parallel
- Same time-frequency resource block

**Digital Array Example (Downlink Two-User):**
- BS with Nt-element digital array
- Serves two single-antenna users
- Signal vector: s = [s₁, s₂]^T
- Beamforming vectors: f₁, f₂ ∈ ℂ^(Nt×1)

**Transmitted Signal:**
$$x = Fs = f_1 s_1 + f_2 s_2$$

where F ≜ [f₁, f₂]

**Received Signal at User k:**
$$y_k = h^H_k x + n_k, \quad k = 1, 2$$

where:
- hk ∈ ℂ^(Nt×1): channel response vector
- nk: Gaussian white noise, power σ²k

**User Decoding:**
- Each user k decodes only desired signal sk
- Treats interference as noise

**Achievable Rate of User k:**
$$r_k = \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{|h^H_k f_k|^2}{|h^H_k f_j|^2 + \sigma^2_k}\right), \quad (k,j) \in \{(1,2), (2,1)\}$$

**Precoder Designs:**
- Zero-Forcing Beamforming (ZFBF)
- Regularized ZFBF
- Optimized precoders

**Applications:**
- 4G and 5G multi-user MIMO
- Massive MIMO
- Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP)

**Key Challenge:**
- If user count > RF chain count: Inter-beam interference unavoidable
- Solution: Proper user grouping method
- Group users by RF chain count
- Assign users with highly correlated channels to same group
- Treat inter-beam interference via cancellation

#### 2) NOMA (Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access)

**Principle:**
Different from OMA, multiple users access same time-frequency-code domain

**Distinction Method:**
- Power domain differentiation
- Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at receiver

**Power Allocation Strategy:**
- Superimpose signals in resource block
- Higher power to user with lower channel gain
- Receiver uses SIC for successive decoding

**Two-User Example:**

*Downlink Scenario:*
- Superposition coding (different from SDMA)
- One user decodes interfering signal before desired signal

*Decoding Orders:*
- **Decode s₁ first:** User 1 directly decodes s₁, treating s₂ as noise
- **Decode s₂ first:** User 2 first decodes s₁, subtracts, then decodes s₂ without s₁ interference

**Achievable Rates:**
$$r_1 = \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{|h^H_1 f_1|^2}{|h^H_1 f_2|^2 + \sigma^2_1}\right)$$
$$r_2 = \log_2 \left(1 + |h^H_2 f_2|^2/\sigma^2_2\right)$$

**Decoding Order Rules:**
- Downlink: Users with worse channel gain decoded first
- Uplink: Users with higher channel gain and lower data rate decoded first

**Performance Advantages (mmWave):**
- High frequency signals have larger channel differences
- NOMA achieves higher achievable-rate gains vs. OMA
- Directional propagation allows users in same beam to leverage array gain
- NOMA + SDMA achieves better performance than SDMA + OMA

**Performance Metrics Comparison:**
- Spectral efficiency improvements
- Sum-rate gains
- Increased served user count

#### 3) RSMA (Rate-Splitting Multiple Access)

**Mechanism:**
- Linear precoded rate-splitting at transmitter
- SIC at receivers

**Key Difference from SDMA/NOMA:**
- Messages split into common and private parts
- Part of each user's message decoded by all users

**Two-User Example:**

*Message Splitting:*
- Common parts of both users → encoded into common stream sc
- Private parts → independently encoded into streams s₁, s₂
- Three streams created: sc, s₁, s₂

*Transmit Signal:*
$$x = F s = f_c s_c + f_1 s_1 + f_2 s_2$$

where:
- fc: common stream precoder (multicast manner)
- fk: private stream precoders (legacy multiuser-precoders like ZFBF)

*Received Signal at User k:*
$$y_k = h^H_k x + n_k$$

*Decoding Process:*
1. Common stream sc decoded first (treating private streams as noise)

**Achievable Rate of Common Stream:**
$$r_{c,k} = \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{|h^H_k f_c|^2}{|h^H_k f_1|^2 + |h^H_k f_2|^2 + \sigma^2_k}\right), \quad k = 1, 2$$

2. Common rate: rc = min(rc,₁, rc,₂)
3. Common stream subtracted via SIC
4. Private stream decoded without common interference

**Achievable Rate of Private Stream:**
$$r_k = \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{|h^H_k f_k|^2}{|h^H_k f_j|^2 + \sigma^2_k}\right), \quad (k,j) \in \{(1,2), (2,1)\}$$

time [22], [34]. The structure of a digital array is shown in
Fig. 4. For each channel, ADC and digital-to-analog converter
(DAC) are required to receive and transmit baseband signals,
and digital beamforming is implemented in the baseband
by digital weighting. Since each antenna is connected to
an independent RF chain, multi-stream transmission can be
supported. Supposing that a signal vector s ∈CNs×1 is

A. New Beamforming Technologies
Traditional beamforming techniques may not be suitable for
future space/air/ground communication networks that require
massive access and high dynamic due to the limited number of
RF chains and high cost. Therefore, some new beamforming
techniques have attracted wide concern and study.
1) Single-RF-Chain Multiple Beams: To balance hardware
cost and beam gain in antenna array enabled communication
systems, hybrid beamforming structure is a suitable paradigm,
in which a few RF chains are able to be connected to a large
antenna array. In general, the number of served users is no
more than the number of RF chains because one RF chain can
only shape one data stream. As the number of users increases,
covering all the users becomes challenging due to the limited
number of RF chains. Hence, single-RF chain

where I is the total number of desired beams. α is a slack

It is shown in [32], [44] that with the optimization approach
multiple beams can also be well shaped.
In addition to the sub-array and optimization techniques,
the RF chain can also be connected to a lens antenna array,
which is a new path division multiplexing paradigm as shown
in Fig. 8, using power splitter/mixer and switch to gener-
ate multiple beams [45]. The RF chain can select different
antennas to connect in order to generate beams steering to
different directions after lens refraction, which greatly reduces
beamforming complexity and hardware cost.

space ranging from 0 to 0.5, four sub-arrays are needed. In
addition to the sub-array scheme, optimization scheme is also
an effective method to design wide beam. For example, in
order to form wide beams to ensure the coverage of broadcast
control signals for massive MIMO systems, an alternating
optimization algorithm was proposed in [48] to optimize the
hybrid precoder, which required the coverage probability for
each user to be larger than a pre-determined threshold, and
the transmit power to be as small as possible.
For certain special user distributions, a wide beam with
circular covered area may not be appropriate because of
unnecessary power cost in areas without users. Flexible beam
coverage that can cover an area with arbitrary shape and size
is more practical. A 3D beamforming approach with a uniform
plane array (UPA) to

scheme with G=3 requires 5 SIC layers at the receivers and
achieves signiﬁcantly lower performance. This demonstrates
how RSMA can achieve signiﬁcant performance gain with
relatively low receiver complexity thanks to the ability to
partially decode interference and partially treat it as noise [83].
RSMA can adjust the amount of interference that is decoded
at each user by adjusting the common stream (power and
content). Since SDMA treats inter-beam interference as noise
and NOMA fully decodes the interference, the two schemes
(along with OMA and other schemes as multicasting) can be
seen as special cases of RSMA [75], [76]. This shows how
powerful RSMA can be at unifying unrelated multiple access
techniques into a single framework seemingly.

transmitters and passive RISs is a crucial problem. Generally
speaking, the deployment of RISs should consider the link
conditions with both transmitters and receivers, spatial user
density, inter-cell interference issue, and so on [41], [88].
Besides, passive beamforming design is essential to steer the
reﬂected signals toward the desired directions. To optimize the
network performance, passive beamforming of RIS is neces-
sarily jointly designed with active beamforming of transmit-
ters/receivers [89]–[91]. It is preferable to consider practical
hardware constraints such as discrete amplitude and phase-
shift levels [92]–[94] in the beamforming design, to ensure
practical communication performance. Moreover, the combi-

In addition to conventional modulation such as PSK and
QAM, RIS-based transmitter can also realize various reﬂection
pattern-related modulation schemes [105]–[109]. Essentially,
these schemes map information bits to different phase shift
matrices of the RIS, while the receiver can demodulate the

In addition to conventional modulation such as PSK and
QAM, RIS-based transmitter can also realize various reﬂection
pattern-related modulation schemes [105]–[109]. Essentially,
these schemes map information bits to different phase shift
matrices of the RIS, while the receiver can demodulate the
information through detecting which phase shift matrix is used.
For example, Fig. 13 shows a RIS-based index modulation
system proposed in [108], which maps the information to the

Then the phase shifts of the RIS are adjusted accordingly
to maximize the received SNR at the m-th receive antenna.

nutshell, for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels,
if the SNR γBob of the channel between Alice and Bob,
which is called the legitimate channel, is higher than that γEve
of the channel between Alice and Eve, which is called the
wiretap channel, secure communication is possible from Alice
to Bob [116]. Suppose that Alice and Bob are equipped with
Nt-element and Nr-element phased arrays, respectively. Thus,
precoding and combining can be performed. The legitimate

full DoFs. Beneﬁting from the additional DoF of FD-MIMO,
ﬂexible 3D beamforming can be employed in BSs to achieve
effective interference coordination in cellular networks [206],

statistical CSI in order to reduce the feedback overhead of
channel estimation. How to obtain instantaneous CSI is a great
challenge for large-scale antenna arrays. Fortunately, the use
of RSMA in large-scale antenna array and massive MIMO
systems has been shown to boost the performance over conven-
tional massive MIMO in the presence of imperfect CSI due to
frequency division duplexing (FDD) quantization [208], [209],

A. New Beamforming Technologies
Traditional beamforming techniques may not be suitable for
future space/air/ground communication networks that require
massive access and high dynamic due to the limited number of
RF chains and high cost. Therefore, some new beamforming
techniques have attracted wide concern and study.
1) Single-RF-Chain Multiple Beams: To balance hardware
cost and beam gain in antenna array enabled communication
systems, hybrid beamforming structure is a suitable paradigm,
in which a few RF chains are able to be connected to a large
antenna array. In general, the number of served users is no
more than the number of RF chains because one RF chain can
only shape one data stream. As the number of users increases,
covering all the users becomes challenging due to the limited
number of RF chains. Hence, single-RF chain

space ranging from 0 to 0.5, four sub-arrays are needed. In
addition to the sub-array scheme, optimization scheme is also
an effective method to design wide beam. For example, in
order to form wide beams to ensure the coverage of broadcast
control signals for massive MIMO systems, an alternating
optimization algorithm was proposed in [48] to optimize the
hybrid precoder, which required the coverage probability for
each user to be larger than a pre-determined threshold, and
the transmit power to be as small as possible.
For certain special user distributions, a wide beam with
circular covered area may not be appropriate because of
unnecessary power cost in areas without users. Flexible beam
coverage that can cover an area with arbitrary shape and size
is more practical. A 3D beamforming approach with a uniform

scheme with G=3 requires 5 SIC layers at the receivers and
achieves signiﬁcantly lower performance. This demonstrates
how RSMA can achieve signiﬁcant performance gain with
relatively low receiver complexity thanks to the ability to
partially decode interference and partially treat it as noise [83].
RSMA can adjust the amount of interference that is decoded
at each user by adjusting the common stream (power and
content). Since SDMA treats inter-beam interference as noise
and NOMA fully decodes the interference, the two schemes
(along with OMA and other schemes as multicasting) can be
seen as special cases of RSMA [75], [76]. This shows how
powerful RSMA can be at unifying unrelated multiple access
techniques into a single framework seemingly.

One possible method for single-RF-chain multi-beam is to
divide the antenna array into several sub-arrays and each sub-
array can generate a beam pointing to a speciﬁc direction as
shown in Fig. 7 (a). A certain number of adjacent antennas
are separated in a group to form multiple sub-arrays that
can generate analog beams steering to desired users [42],
[43]. We present the simulation results of generating multiple
beams via sub-array techniques. First, a phased array with
64 elements is uniformly divided into two sub-arrays and
four sub-arrays, respectively. Then, analog beamforming is
performed to generate multiple beams pointing to different
directions. As shown in Fig. 7 (b), with different numbers
of sub-arrays, the number of beams can be adjusted ﬂexibly.
Besides, as the number of sub-arrays increases, the number of
antennas in each sub-array decreases, which results in a loss
of the beam gain. Therefore, the tradeoff between the number

Nevertheless, it may have disadvantages of a higher sidelobe

Fix-beam Antenna Arrays
Fix-beam antenna arrays include single beam arrays and
multiple beam arrays (MBAs). The single beam arrays usually
consist of radiation elements and relatively simple feeding
network, which are cheap to be exploited to track satellites and
airplanes on an electronic-controlled turntable. MBAs are usu-
ally installed on the satellite to serve users in different regions
with multiple narrow beams generated by the Butler matrix,
lens, reﬂector antennas with multiple feedings. The lens-
based MBAs mainly include the Rotman lens and Luneberg
lens [31]. The Rotman lens has a two-dimensional (2D) true-

differences between the adjacent output port of the lens will

Hybrid Antenna Arrays
To balance the performance and cost, hybrid antenna arrays
with analog-digital hybrid beamforming are proposed and

7
fabricated for coverage in satellite communications [35]. In 5G
wireless communications, the hybrid antenna arrays are also
exploited in massive MIMO systems to decrease the cost with
hybrid precoding and combining [36]. For a hybrid antenna
array, a large number of antennas are connected with small
amount of RF chains via phase shifters, and thus multi-stream
transmission are enabled with high gains and relatively low
cost. Let N RF
t
and N RF
r
denote the number of RF chains
at the transmitter and receiver respectively, where we usually
have N RF
t
≪Nt and N RF
r
≪Nr. At the transmitter, signals
are ﬁrst processed by low-dimensional digital beamforming,
and then processed by high-dimensional analog beamforming.
While at the receiver, the order is reversed. The received signal
vector at the receiver is given by
y = WH
BBWH
RFHFRFFBBs + WH

where WBB ∈CNRF

are the
digital beamforming matrix and analog beamforming matrix
at the receiver, respectively. While FBB ∈CNRF

Programmable Metasurfaces
In recent years, programmable metasurfaces were devel-
oped to substitute the phased array partially because of the
simple structure, low power consumption, and low cost. Pro-
grammable metasurfaces have potential in various platforms
including satellites and airplanes. They can also be exploited

in the user end as high gain antennas. Programmable meta-
surfaces empowered RISs have aroused global attention and
interest of both academia and industry, and thus constitute one
of the key technologies in future 6G mobile network [7].
The beam of a programmable metasurface is controlled by
the periodic structure of the metasurface, which is also know
as passive beamforming. The phase state of each element is
usually controlled with 0 and 180 degrees, while sometimes
ﬁner degree control may also be implemented. The binary
phase states are easily implemented by PIN diodes on the
surface. Programmable metasurfa
