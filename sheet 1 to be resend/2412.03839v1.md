## 3. MATHEMATICAL MODELS AND EQUATIONS

### System-Level Notation and Framework

**Signal Reception and Transmission:**

The general model for FAS systems involves:
- Transmitter with position or shape variability: T = {position, shape, polarization, ...}
- Receiver with position or shape variability: R = {position, shape, polarization, ...}
- Channel h(T,R) dependent on both transmitter and receiver configurations

**Basic Performance Metrics:**

**1. Communication Rate R**
- Definition: Achievable data rate in bits/s/Hz (spectral efficiency)
- Dependencies: R = f(Pmax, σ²I, h(positions), beamforming weights)
- Optimization: max R over antenna positions and beamforming
- Shannon Capacity: R ≈ log₂(1 + SNR) base formulation

**2. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**
- Expression: SNR = E(PS|γk|²/σ²)
  - PS = Transmit power (Watts)
  - γk = Channel fading coefficient (complex-valued)
  - σ² = Noise power (Watts)
  - E(·) = Expectation over channel states

- Linear form: SNR (dB) = 10·log₁₀(SNR_linear)

- SWIPT Case: SNR = Pmax/σ²I (power ratio)

**3. Outage Probability**
- Definition: P_out = Pr(R < R_target)
  - R = instantaneous achievable rate
  - R_target = required target rate
  - Pr(·) = probability

- Application: FAS-RIS case
  - Target rate: R_target = 3 bit/s/Hz
  - Varies with number of ports N

- Interpretation: 
  - P_out = 10⁻⁴ means 0.01% failure probability
  - 99.99% link availability for 3 bit/s/Hz transmission

**4. Antenna Spacing Constraint**
- Formula: D ≥ λ/2
  - D = minimum distance between two FAs
  - λ = wavelength at operating frequency

- Case Study: λ = 1 m (implies operating frequency ≈ 300 MHz)
- FAS Minimum Spacing: D = 0.5 m in case study
- Purpose: Ensures spatial independence and diversity

**5. Energy Harvesting Efficiency**
- Definition: η = P_harvested / P_received
- SWIPT Case Study: η = 0.5 (50% conversion efficiency)
- Combined metric: 
  - Power available to device = η × Received power
  - Energy receiver optimization accounts for this factor

**Field Response Model (F1):**
- Number of paths: L (typically 2-5 in practice)
- Path gains: {α_l} for l = 1,...,L
- Path phases: {θ_l} for l = 1,...,L
- Angle of departure: θ_tx
- Angle of arrival: θ_rx
- Path delays: {τ_l}

- Path response: h(t) = Σ(l=1 to L) α_l exp(jθ_l) δ(t - τ_l)

**Correlation Model (F2):**

  - m,n = port indices
  - h_m, h_n = channel coefficients at ports m and n
  - * = complex conjugate
  - E[·] = expectation

- Jake's Model: R[m,n] = J₀(2π f_d τ_{mn})
  - J₀ = Bessel function of first kind

### System-Level Notation and Framework

**Signal Reception and Transmission:**

The general model for FAS systems involves:
- Transmitter with position or shape variability: T = {position, shape, polarization, ...}
- Receiver with position or shape variability: R = {position, shape, polarization, ...}
- Channel h(T,R) dependent on both transmitter and receiver configurations

**Basic Performance Metrics:**

**1. Communication Rate R**
- Definition: Achievable data rate in bits/s/Hz (spectral efficiency)
- Dependencies: R = f(Pmax, σ²I, h(positions), beamforming weights)
- Optimization: max R over antenna positions and beamforming
- Shannon Capacity: R ≈ log₂(1 + SNR) base formulation

**2. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**
- Expression: SNR = E(PS|γk|²/σ²)
  - PS = Transmit power (Watts)
  - γk = Channel fading coefficient (complex-valued)
  - σ² = Noise power (Watts)
  - E(·) = Expectation over channel states

- Linear form: SNR (dB) = 10·log₁₀(SNR_linear)

- SWIPT Case: SNR = Pmax/σ²I (power ratio)

**3. Outage Probability**
- Definition: P_out = Pr(R < R_target)
  - R = instantaneous achievable rate
  - R_target = required target rate
  - Pr(·) = probability

- Application: FAS-RIS case
  - Target rate: R_target = 3 bit/s/Hz
  - Varies with number of ports N

- Interpretation: 
  - P_out = 10⁻⁴ means 0.01% failure probability
  - 99.99% link availability for 3 bit/s/Hz transmission

**4. Antenna Spacing Constraint**
- Formula: D ≥ λ/2
  - D = minimum distance between two FAs
  - λ = wavelength at operating frequency

- Case Study: λ = 1 m (implies operating frequency ≈ 300 MHz)
- FAS Minimum Spacing: D = 0.5 m in case study
- Purpose: Ensures spatial independence and diversity

**5. Energy Harvesting Efficiency**
- Definition: η = P_harvested / P_received
- SWIPT Case Study: η = 0.5 (50% conversion efficiency)
- Combined metric: 
  - Power available to device = η × Received power
  - Energy receiver optimization accounts for this factor

**6. Channel Model Parameters**

**Field Response Model (F1):**
- Number of paths: L (typically 2-5 in practice)
- Path gains: {α_l} for l = 1,...,L
- Path phases: {θ_l} for l = 1,...,L
- Angle of departure: θ_tx
- Angle of arrival: θ_rx
- Path delays: {τ_l}

- Path response: h(t) = Σ(l=1 to L) α_l exp(jθ_l) δ(t - τ_l)

**Correlation Model (F2):**
- Channel correlation: R[m,n] = E[h_m h*_n]
  - m,n = port indices
  - h_m, h_n = channel coefficients at ports m and n
  - * = complex conjugate
  - E[·] = expectation

- Jake's Model: R[m,n] = J₀(2π f_d τ_{mn})
  - J₀ = Bessel function of first kind
  - f_d = Doppler frequency
  - τ_{mn} = time delay between ports

**Block Correlation Model (CLT-BC):**
- Simplified approximation with good tractability
- Balances accuracy and analytical capability
- Used in FAS-RIS case study [11]

**Context (verbatim excerpt):**

A. Structures An obvious design for a FA is liquid metal (LM) fiber [4], as depicted in Fig. 1(a). It is made by injecting liquid metal into elastic micro-channels or hollow fibers. LM fibers, made by molding silicone or commercially available hollow fibers, offer excellent mechanical elasticity and can withstand numerous strain cycles without degradation. The high conductivity of liquid metal minimizes resistive losses, thereby reducing energy consumption during signal transmission. This durable and lightweight design ensures long-term reliability in harsh environments while maintaining energy efficiency. Another design for a FA is to utilize conductive fluid inside a tube-like container, in which the fluid can be mobilized by a digitally controlled nano-pump [2, Section VI-B], as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The controller adjusts dynamically the antenna’s position (a.k.a. port), shape and size based on the channel condition in real time, ensuring best performance. This agility makes it ideal for dynamic environments, or rapidly changing network settings as typically faced at mobile devices, obtaining consistency and stability in link connections. Fig. 1(c) illustrates another examp

**Context (verbatim excerpt):**

III. APPLICATIONS ASSISTED BY FAS With the reconfigurability FAS possesses, it is expected that FAS can find many applications in wireless networks. In this section, we discuss several obvious applications, as illustrated in Fig. 2, that FAS can contribute to massively. A. Simultaneous Wireless Information, and Power Transfer (SWIPT) SWIPT has been an attractive feature to support the growing number of battery-powered devices for wireless connections. The fact that SWIPT aims to deliver data and energy concurrently makes it a smart technique but it also puts strains on the SWIPT transmitter. If the transmitter relies on a FPA, then both communication and power transfer efficiencies will be degraded. In this case, replacing FPA by FAS can empower the SWIPT transmitter for more DoF to elevate the performance of both communication and power transfer [9]. This is especially important if the transmitter is a mobile device as the number of RF chains tends to be very small. Evidently, a SWIPT mobile receiver benefits as well if FAS is deployed. A FPA has no DoF to optimize the received signal for SWIPT but a FAS can reconfigure itself to receive the best signal for power transfer and anot

**Context (verbatim excerpt):**

Consider a FAS-assisted SWIPT system, which contains a BS, an information receiver (IR), and an energy receiver -5 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Fig. 3: Pmax/σ2 I versus R. (ER). The BS is equipped with 4 FAs. The IR and ER are both equipped with a single FA. We assume that the energy harvesting efficiency is set to 0.5 (i.e., 50%). The minimum distance between two FAs is set to be D = λ/2 with λ = 1 m. All other parameters are the same as those used in [9]. In this case study, we adopt the field response-based channel model to capture the geometric relationships between the FAs. This modeling approach considers finite multipath propagation effects (3 channel paths were considered in the simulations) and the angles of signal departure and arrival among different antenna positions, allowing for the optimization of antenna positions to enhance communication performance. Explicitly, in [9], an iterative algorithm was proposed for jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming of BS, the locations of receive FAs within IR and ER, and the locations of transmit FA within the BS for maximizing the communication rate at the IR, denoted by R. We compare this scheme (called ‘FAS’) to the following three benchmarks: 1) Transmit FA (TFA): The BS has M FAs, each of which is equipped with an independent RF chain, while the IR and ER are both equipped with a single FPA. 2) Receive FA (RFA): The BS

![Fig. 4: Outage probability versus the number of ports $N$.](assets/Fig4.png)

**Context (verbatim excerpt):**

Another direction is combining FAS and RIS systems. This case study considers a RIS-assisted downlink communication system comprising a BS with a single FPA, a RIS with M reflecting elements, and a mobile user (MU) equipped with a single FA. Also, the direct link between the BS and the MU is assumed to be broken by obstacles. The distance between the BS and RIS and that between the RIS and the MU are both set to 200 meters. The wireless channel is assumed to undergo rich scattering, hence following Rayleigh fading. Detailed setup of other system parameters is set according to [11]. Results in Fig. 4 are provided for the outage probability against the number of ports, N, of FAS, where the value of M is set to 40 or 45. The noise power is σ2 n = 10−8 W, and the transmit power is PS = 0.1 W. Therefore, the average received SNR is E(PS|γk|2/σ2) = 10 dB and 11.0231 dB for M = 40 and M = 45, respectively. The target data rate is R = 3 bit/s/Hz. In the numerical results, several different channel models with different properties were used. The block correlation model in [11] is denoted by ‘CLT-BC’. This model is known to have great accuracy and analytical tractability. In addition, we als

## Simulation results and performance metrics

### Case study A: FAS-SWIPT systems (page 7)

Consider a FAS-assisted SWIPT system, which contains a BS, an information receiver (IR), and an energy receiver -5 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Fig. 3: Pmax/σ2 I versus R. (ER). The BS is equipped with 4 FAs. The IR and ER are both equipped with a single FA. We assume that the energy harvesting efficiency is set to 0.5 (i.e., 50%). The minimum distance between two FAs is set to be D = λ/2 with λ = 1 m. All other parameters are the same as those used in [9]. In this case study, we adopt the field response-based channel model to capture the geometric relationships between the FAs. This modeling approach considers finite multipath propagation effects (3 channel paths were considered in the simulations) and the angles of signal departure and arrival among different antenna positions, allowing for the optimization of antenna positions to enhance communication performance. Explicitly, in [9], an iterative algorithm was proposed for jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming of BS, the locations of receive FAs within IR and ER, and the locations of transmit FA within the BS for maximizing the communication rate at the IR, denoted by R. We compare this scheme (called ‘FAS’) to the following three benchmarks: 1) Transmit FA (TFA): The BS has M FAs, each of which is equipped with an independent RF chain, while the IR and ER are both equipped with a single FPA. 2) Receive FA (RFA): The BS has M FPAs, while the IR and ER are both equipped with a single FA each. 3) FPA: The BS is equipped with M FPAs, while the IR and ER are both equipped with a single FPA. Our interest is to analyze the effect of the transmit power to noise ratio, denoted by Pmax/σ2 I, with M = 4 as shown in Fig. 3. The results in this figure show that the communication rate for all the schemes increases with Pmax/σ2 I. This is expected as a high SNR should allow a high data rate to be achieved and increase harvested energy. Additionally, the ‘FAS’ scheme consistently outperforms the benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing the communication rate. The substantial improvements, particularly the 73.1% enhancement over the FPA scheme, highlight the superior gain provided by FAS in optimizing the system performance.

### Case study B: FAS-RIS systems (page 8)

Another direction is combining FAS and RIS systems. This case study considers a RIS-assisted downlink communication system comprising a BS with a single FPA, a RIS with M reflecting elements, and a mobile user (MU) equipped with a single FA. Also, the direct link between the BS and the MU is assumed to be broken by obstacles. The distance between the BS and RIS and that between the RIS and the MU are both set to 200 meters. The wireless channel is assumed to undergo rich scattering, hence following Rayleigh fading. Detailed setup of other system parameters is set according to [11]. Results in Fig. 4 are provided for the outage probability against the number of ports, N, of FAS, where the value of M is set to 40 or 45. The noise power is σ2 n = 10−8 W, and the transmit power is PS = 0.1 W. Therefore, the average received SNR is E(PS|γk|2/σ2) = 10 dB and 11.0231 dB for M = 40 and M = 45, respectively. The target data rate is R = 3 bit/s/Hz. In the numerical results, several different channel models with different properties were used. The block correlation model in [11] is denoted by ‘CLT-BC’. This model is known to have great accuracy and analytical tractability. In addition, we also have the constant correlation model, denoted by ‘Constant’. This model is preferred when simplicity is the priority but it tends to overestimate the performance. As observed, increasing the number of FAS ports N from 5 to 50 significantly reduces outage probabilities, emphasizing the critical role of FAS in enhancing communication performance. Similarly, increasing the number of RIS elements M from 40 to 45 provides additional improvements, highlighting the potential of RIS technology to enhance network reliability. These results demonstrate a synergistic relationship between FAS and RIS, which can be effectively leveraged to significantly improve the reliability and efficiency of wireless networks. VI. CONCLUSIONS Reconfigurable antennas have begun to demonstrate their value in revolutionizing wireless communication systems, and fluid antenna systems (FAS) are taking the lead by showcasing unparalleled flexibility and efficiency. This article categorizes the diverse implementation techniques for realizing FAS, emphasizing their unique strengths and characteristics. We have also highlighted key applications where FAS stands out, such as SWIPT, ISAC, NOMA, RIS, PLS, MEC, and others, illustrating the unique advantages it brings to existing technologies. Furthermore, we addressed pressing challenges surrounding FAS, identifying five strategic research directions that can guide future innovations. To solidify its potential, the article concluded with two case studies that illustrate the clear benefits and transformative potential of FAS in advancing next-generation wireless systems. These findings underscore the pivotal role of FAS in shaping the future of wireless communications and provide a roadmap for further exploration and development in this exciting field.
